# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod delectatio fugienda est ad vitandum peccatum, non totaliter, sed ut non ultra quaeratur quam necessitas requirat.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 In order to avoid sin, pleasure must be shunned, not altogether, but so that it is not sought more than necessity requires.

Ad tertium dicendum quod id quod ad naturam pertinet in pueris est augmentandum et fovendum. Quod autem pertinet ad defectum rationis in eis non est fovendum, sed emendandum, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 That which regards nature should be nourished and fostered in children, but that which pertains to the lack of reason in them should not be fostered, but corrected, as stated above.

Ad tertium dicendum quod in timiditate consideratur magis voluntarium in universali, minus tamen in particulari. Et ideo in ea est magis voluntarium secundum quid, sed non simpliciter.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The voluntary, in cowardice, depends rather on a general than on a particular consideration: wherefore in such cases we have the voluntary not simply but in a restricted sense.
