# Summa Theologica

Et per hoc patet responsio ad obiecta.
        
This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

Ad sextum dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, recompensatio beneficii praecipue pendet ex affectu. Et ideo eo modo debet recompensatio fieri quo magis sit utilis, si tamen postea, per eius incuriam, in damnum ipsius vertatur, non imputatur recompensanti. Unde Seneca dicit, in VII de Benefic., reddendum mihi est, non servandum, cum reddidero, ac tuendum.
        
Reply to Objection 6:
 As stated in the preceding reply, repayment of a favor depends chiefly on the affection of the heart: wherefore repayment should be made in such a way as to prove most beneficial. If, however, through the benefactor's carelessness it prove detrimental to him, this is not imputed to the person who repays him, as Seneca observes (De Benef. vii): "It is my duty to repay, and not to keep back and safeguard my repayment."

Ad tertium dicendum quod beneficia etiam sunt opportuno tempore danda. Et tunc non est amplius tardandum cum opportunum tempus advenerit. Et idem etiam observari oportet in beneficiorum recompensatione.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Favors also should be conferred at a convenient time and one should no longer delay when the convenient time comes; and the same is to be observed in repaying favors.
