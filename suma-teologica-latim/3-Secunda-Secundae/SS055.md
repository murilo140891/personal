# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod iustitia et temperantia in sui ratione important id unde virtus laudatur, scilicet aequalitatem et concupiscentiarum refrenationem, et ideo nunquam accipiuntur in malo. Sed nomen prudentiae sumitur a providendo, sicut supra dictum est, quod potest etiam ad mala extendi. Et ideo, licet prudentia simpliciter dicta in bono accipiatur, aliquo tamen addito potest accipi in malo. Et secundum hoc dicitur prudentia carnis esse peccatum.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 Justice and temperance include in their very nature that which ranks them among the virtues, viz. equality and the curbing of concupiscence; hence they are never taken in a bad sense. On the other hand prudence is so called from foreseeing [providendo], as stated above (
Question [47]
, 
Article [1]
; 
Question [49]
, 
Article [6]
), which can extend to evil things also. Therefore, although prudence is taken simply in a good sense, yet, if something be added, it may be taken in a bad sense: and it is thus that prudence of the flesh is said to be a sin.




Ad secundum dicendum quod caro est propter animam sicut materia propter formam et instrumentum propter principale agens. Et ideo sic licite diligitur caro ut ordinetur ad bonum animae sicut ad finem. Si autem in ipso bono carnis constituatur ultimus finis, erit inordinata et illicita dilectio. Et hoc modo ad amorem carnis ordinatur prudentia carnis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The flesh is on account of the soul, as matter is on account of the form, and the instrument on account of the principal agent. Hence the flesh is loved lawfully, if it be directed to the good of the soul as its end. If, however, a man place his last end in a good of the flesh, his love will be inordinate and unlawful, and it is thus that the prudence of the flesh is directed to the love of the flesh.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Diabolus nos tentat non per modum appetibilis, sed per modum suggerentis. Et ideo, cum prudentia importet ordinem ad aliquem finem appetibilem, non ita dicitur prudentia Diaboli sicut prudentia respectu alicuius mali finis, sub cuius ratione tentat nos mundus et caro, inquantum scilicet proponuntur nobis ad appetendum bona mundi vel carnis. Et ideo dicitur prudentia carnis, et etiam prudentia mundi, secundum illud Luc. XVI, filii huius saeculi prudentiores sunt in generatione sua et cetera. Apostolus autem totum comprehendit sub prudentia carnis, quia etiam exteriores res mundi appetimus propter carnem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The devil tempts us, not through the good of the appetible object, but by way of suggestion. Wherefore, since prudence implies direction to some appetible end, we do not speak of "prudence of the devil," as of a prudence directed to some evil end, which is the aspect under which the world and the flesh tempt us, in so far as worldly or carnal goods are proposed to our appetite. Hence we speak of "carnal" and again of "worldly" prudence, according to Lk. 16:8, "The children of this world are more prudent [Douay: 'wiser'] in their generation," etc. The Apostle includes all in the "prudence of the flesh," because we covet the external things of the world on account of the flesh.




Potest tamen dici quod quia prudentia quodammodo dicitur sapientia, ut supra dictum est, ideo secundum tres tentationes potest intelligi triplex prudentia. Unde dicitur Iac. III sapientia esse terrena, animalis, diabolica, ut supra expositum est cum de sapientia ageretur
        

          We may also reply that since prudence is in a certain sense called "wisdom," as stated above (
Question [47]
, 
Article [2]
, ad 1), we may distinguish a threefold prudence corresponding to the three kinds of temptation. Hence it is written (
James 3:15
) that there is a wisdom which is "earthly, sensual and devilish," as explained above (
Question [45]
, 
Article [1]
, ad 1), when we were treating of wisdom.

Ad tertium dicendum quod omne peccatum opponitur prudentiae, sicut et prudentia participatur in omni virtute. Sed ideo non oportet quod quodlibet peccatum prudentiae oppositum sit gravissimum, sed solum quando opponitur prudentiae in aliquo maximo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Every sin is opposed to prudence, just as prudence is shared by every virtue. But it does not follow that every sin opposed to prudence is most grave, but only when it is opposed to prudence in some very grave matter.

Ad tertium dicendum quod sollicitudo temporalium in operibus misericordiae ordinatur ad finem caritatis. Et ideo non est illicita, nisi sit superflua.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 In the works of mercy solicitude about temporal things is directed to charity as its end, wherefore it is not unlawful, unless it be superfluous.
