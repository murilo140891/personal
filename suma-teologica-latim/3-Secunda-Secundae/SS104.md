# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod etsi non semper teneatur homo velle quod Deus vult, semper tamen tenetur velle quod Deus vult eum velle. Et hoc homini praecipue innotescit per praeceptum divinum. Et ideo tenetur homo in omnibus divinis praeceptis obedire.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Though man is not always bound to will what God wills, yet he is always bound to will what God wills him to will. This comes to man's knowledge chiefly through God's command, wherefore man is bound to obey God's commands in all things.
