# Summa Theologica

Ad sextum dicendum quod quoad Deum sola voluntas facit simoniacum, sed quoad poenam ecclesiasticam exteriorem, non punitur ut simoniacus, ut abrenuntiare teneatur, sed debet de mala intentione poenitere.
        
Reply to Objection 6:
 In God's sight the mere will makes a man guilty of simony; but as regards the external ecclesiastical punishment he is not punished as a simoniac, by being obliged to resign, but is bound to repent of his evil intention.




Ad septimum dicendum quod dispensare cum eo qui est scienter beneficiatus, solus Papa potest. In aliis autem casibus potest etiam episcopus dispensare, ita tamen quod prius abrenuntiet quod simoniace acquisivit. Et tunc dispensationem consequatur vel parvam, ut habeat laicam communionem; vel magnam, ut, post poenitentiam, in alia Ecclesia in suo ordine remaneat; vel maiorem, ut remaneat in eadem, sed in minoribus ordinibus; vel maximam, ut in eadem Ecclesia etiam maiores ordines exequatur, non tamen praelationem accipiat.
        
Reply to Objection 7:
 The Pope alone can grant a dispensation to one who has knowingly received a benefice (simoniacally). In other cases the bishop also can dispense, provided the beneficiary first of all renounce what he has received simoniacally, so that he will receive either the lesser dispensation allowing him to communicate with the laity, or a greater dispensation, allowing him after doing penance to retain his order in some other Church; or again a greater dispensation, allowing him to remain in the same Church, but in minor orders; or a full dispensation allowing him to exercise even the major orders in the same Church, but not to accept a prelacy.
