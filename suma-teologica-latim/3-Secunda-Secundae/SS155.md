# Summa Theologica

Quarto, de comparatione eius ad temperantiam.
        


(4)
 Of its comparison with temperance.

Ad tertium dicendum quod Glossa ibi loquitur de continentia secundum primum modum, secundum quem continentia nominat quandam virtutem perfectam, quae non solum abstinet ab illicitis bonis, sed etiam a quibusdam licitis minus bonis, ut totaliter intendatur perfectioribus bonis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The gloss quoted takes continence in the first sense, as denoting a perfect virtue, which refrains not merely from unlawful goods, but also from certain lawful things that are lesser goods, in order to give its whole attention to the more perfect goods.
