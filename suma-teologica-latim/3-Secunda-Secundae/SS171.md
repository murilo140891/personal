# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod auctoritates illae loquuntur de prophetia quantum ad hoc tertium, quod assumitur ut prophetiae argumentum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 These passages speak of prophecy in reference to the third point just mentioned, which regards the proof of prophecy.




Ad secundum dicendum quod apostolus ibi loquitur quantum ad propheticam enuntiationem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The Apostle is speaking there of the prophetic utterances.
      


Ad tertium dicendum quod illi qui dicuntur prophetae insani et stulti, non sunt veri prophetae, sed falsi, de quibus dicitur Ierem. XXIII, nolite audire verba prophetarum qui prophetant vobis et decipiunt vos, visionem cordis sui loquuntur, non de ore domini; et Ezech. XIII, haec dicit dominus, vae prophetis insipientibus, qui sequuntur spiritum suum, et nihil vident.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Those prophets who are described as foolish and mad are not true but false prophets, of whom it is said (
Jer. 3:16
): "Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, and deceive you; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord," and (Ezech. 13:3): "Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and see nothing."




Ad quartum dicendum quod in prophetia requiritur quod intentio mentis elevetur ad percipienda divina, unde dicitur Ezech. II, fili hominis, sta super pedes tuos, et loquar tecum. Haec autem elevatio intentionis fit spiritu sancto movente, unde ibi subditur, et ingressus est in me spiritus, et statuit me super pedes meos. Postquam autem intentio mentis elevata est ad superna, percipit divina, unde subditur, et audivi loquentem ad me. Sic igitur ad prophetiam requiritur inspiratio quantum ad mentis elevationem, secundum illud Iob XXXII, inspiratio omnipotentis dat intelligentiam, revelatio autem, quantum ad ipsam perceptionem divinorum, in quo perficitur prophetia; per ipsam removetur obscuritatis et ignorantiae velamen, secundum illud Iob XII, qui revelat profunda de tenebris.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 It is requisite to prophecy that the intention of the mind be raised to the perception of Divine things: wherefore it is written (Ezech. 2:1): "Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee." This raising of the intention is brought about by the motion of the Holy Ghost, wherefore the text goes on to say: "And the Spirit entered into me... and He set me upon my feet." After the mind's intention has been raised to heavenly things, it perceives the things of God; hence the text continues: "And I heard Him speaking to me." Accordingly inspiration is requisite for prophecy, as regards the raising of the mind, according to Job 32:8, "The inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding": while revelation is necessary, as regards the very perception of Divine things, whereby prophecy is completed; by its means the veil of darkness and ignorance is removed, according to Job 12:22, "He discovereth great things out of darkness."

Ad tertium dicendum quod ille qui habet aliquam scientiam, cognoscit principia illius scientiae, ex quibus omnia quae sunt illius scientiae dependent. Et ideo qui perfecte habet habitum alicuius scientiae, scit omnia quae ad illam scientiam pertinent. Sed per prophetiam non cognoscitur in seipso principium propheticalium cognitionum quod est Deus. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 He who has a science knows the principles of that science, whence whatever is pertinent to that science depends; wherefore to have the habit of a science perfectly, is to know whatever is pertinent to that science. But God Who is the principle of prophetic knowledge is not known in Himself through prophecy; wherefore the comparison fails.

Ad tertium dicendum quod, quia eadem est veritas prophetiae et divinae praescientiae, ut dictum est, hoc modo ista conditionalis est vera, si aliquid est prophetatum, erit, sicut ista, si aliquid est praescitum, erit. In utraque enim antecedens est impossibile non esse. Unde et consequens est necessarium, non secundum quod est futurum respectu nostri, sed ut consideratur in suo praesenti, prout subiicitur praescientiae divinae, ut in primo dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Since the same truth of prophecy is the same as the truth of Divine foreknowledge, as stated above, the conditional proposition: "If this was prophesied, it will be," is true in the same way as the proposition: "If this was foreknown, it will be": for in both cases it is impossible for the antecedent not to be. Hence the consequent is necessary, considered, not as something future in our regard, but as being present to the Divine foreknowledge, as stated in the FP, Question [14], Article [13], ad 2.
