# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod fides est necessaria tanquam principium spiritualis vitae. Et ideo praesupponitur ad legis susceptionem.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Faith is necessary as being the principle of spiritual life, wherefore it is presupposed before the receiving of the Law.
      


Ad secundum dicendum quod ibi etiam dominus praesupponit aliquid de fide, scilicet fidem unius Dei, cum dicit, creditis in Deum, et aliquid praecipit, scilicet fidem incarnationis, per quam unus est Deus et homo; quae quidem fidei explicatio pertinet ad fidem novi testamenti. Et ideo subdit, et in me credite.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Even then Our Lord both presupposed something of faith, namely belief in one God, when He said: "You believe in God," and commanded something, namely, belief in the Incarnation whereby one Person is God and man. This explanation of faith belongs to the faith of the New Testament, wherefore He added: "Believe also in Me."




Ad tertium dicendum quod praecepta prohibitiva respiciunt peccata, quae corrumpunt virtutem. Virtus autem corrumpitur ex particularibus defectibus, ut supra dictum est. Et ideo, praesupposita fide unius Dei, in lege veteri fuerunt danda prohibitiva praecepta, quibus homines prohiberentur ab his particularibus defectibus per quos fides corrumpi posset.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The prohibitive precepts regard sins, which corrupt virtue. Now virtue is corrupted by any particular defect, as stated above (FS, Question [18], Article [4], ad 3; FS, Question [19], Article [6], ad 1, Article [7], ad 3). Therefore faith in one God being presupposed, prohibitive precepts had to be given in the Old Law, so that men might be warned off those particular defects whereby their faith might be corrupted.




Ad quartum dicendum quod etiam confessio vel doctrina fidei praesupponit subiectionem hominis ad Deum per fidem. Et ideo magis potuerunt dari praecepta in veteri lege pertinentia ad confessionem et doctrinam fidei quam pertinentia ad ipsam fidem.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Confession of faith and the teaching thereof also presuppose man's submission to God by faith: so that the Old Law could contain precepts relating to the confession and teaching of faith, rather than to faith itself.




Ad quintum dicendum quod in illa etiam auctoritate praesupponitur fides per quam credimus Deum esse, unde praemittit, qui timetis Deum, quod non posset esse sine fide. Quod autem addit, credite illi, ad quaedam credibilia specialia referendum est, et praecipue ad illa quae promittit Deus sibi obedientibus. Unde subdit, et non evacuabitur merces vestra.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 In this passage again that faith is presupposed whereby we believe that God is; hence it begins, "Ye that fear the Lord," which is not possible without faith. The words which follow—"believe Him"—must be referred to certain special articles of faith, chiefly to those things which God promises to them that obey Him, wherefore the passage concludes—"and your reward shall not be made void."

Ad secundum dicendum quod ibi etiam dominus praesupponit aliquid de fide, scilicet fidem unius Dei, cum dicit, creditis in Deum, et aliquid praecipit, scilicet fidem incarnationis, per quam unus est Deus et homo; quae quidem fidei explicatio pertinet ad fidem novi testamenti.
