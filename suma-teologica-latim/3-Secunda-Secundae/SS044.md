# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod omnia praecepta Decalogi ordinantur ad dilectionem Dei et proximi. Et ideo praecepta caritatis non fuerunt connumeranda inter praecepta Decalogi, sed in omnibus includuntur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 All the precepts of the decalogue are directed to the love of God and of our neighbor: and therefore the precepts of charity had not to be enumerated among the precepts of the decalogue, since they are included in all of them.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod sub praecepto quod datur de actu alicuius virtutis non cadit modus quem habet ille actus ex alia superiori virtute. Cadit tamen sub praecepto modus ille qui pertinet ad rationem propriae virtutis. Et talis modus significatur cum dicitur, ex toto corde.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The commandment that prescribes an act of virtue does not prescribe the mode which that virtue derives from another and higher virtue, but it does prescribe the mode which belongs to its own proper virtue, and this mode is signified in the words "with thy whole heart."




Ad secundum dicendum quod dupliciter contingit ex toto corde Deum diligere. Uno quidem modo, in actu, idest ut totum cor hominis semper actualiter in Deum feratur. Et ista est perfectio patriae. Alio modo, ut habitualiter totum cor hominis in Deum feratur, ita scilicet quod nihil contra Dei dilectionem cor hominis recipiat. Et haec est perfectio viae. Cui non contrariatur peccatum veniale, quia non tollit habitum caritatis, cum non tendat in oppositum obiectum; sed solum impedit caritatis usum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 To love God with one's whole heart has a twofold signification. First, actually, so that a man's whole heart be always actually directed to God: this is the perfection of heaven. Secondly, in the sense that a man's whole heart be habitually directed to God, so that it consent to nothing contrary to the love of God, and this is the perfection of the way. Venial sin is not contrary to this latter perfection, because it does not destroy the habit of charity, since it does not tend to a contrary object, but merely hinders the use of charity.




Ad tertium dicendum quod perfectio caritatis ad quam ordinantur consilia est media inter duas perfectiones praedictas, ut scilicet homo, quantum possibile est, se abstrahat a rebus temporalibus etiam licitis, quae, occupando animum, impediunt actualem motum cordis in Deum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 That perfection of charity to which the counsels are directed, is between the two perfections mentioned in the preceding reply: and it consists in man renouncing, as much as possible, temporal things, even such as are lawful, because they occupy the mind and hinder the actual movement of the heart towards God.

Et per hoc patet responsio ad obiecta.
        
This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

Respondeo dicendum quod hoc praeceptum convenienter traditur, tangitur enim in eo et diligendi ratio et dilectionis modus. Ratio quidem diligendi tangitur ex eo quod proximus nominatur, propter hoc enim ex caritate debemus alios diligere, quia sunt nobis proximi et secundum naturalem Dei imaginem et secundum capacitatem gloriae. Nec refert utrum dicatur proximus vel frater, ut habetur I Ioan. IV; vel amicus, ut habetur Lev. XIX, quia per omnia haec eadem affinitas designatur.
        
I answer that,
 This precept is fittingly expressed, for it indicates both the reason for loving and the mode of love. The reason for loving is indicated in the word "neighbor," because the reason why we ought to love others out of charity is because they are nigh to us, both as to the natural image of God, and as to the capacity for glory. Nor does it matter whether we say "neighbor," or "brother" according to 1 Jn. 4:21, or "friend," according to Lev. 19:18, because all these words express the same affinity.




Modus autem dilectionis tangitur cum dicitur, sicut teipsum. Quod non est intelligendum quantum ad hoc quod aliquis proximum aequaliter sibi diligat; sed similiter sibi. Et hoc tripliciter. Primo quidem, ex parte finis, ut scilicet aliquis diligat proximum propter Deum, sicut et seipsum propter Deum debet diligere; ut sic sit dilectio proximi sancta. Secundo, ex parte regulae dilectionis, ut scilicet aliquis non condescendat proximo in aliquo malo, sed solum in bonis, sicut et suae voluntati satisfacere debet homo solum in bonis; ut sic sit dilectio proximi iusta. Tertio, ex parte rationis dilectionis, ut scilicet non diligat aliquis proximum propter propriam utilitatem vel delectationem, sed ea ratione quod velit proximo bonum, sicut vult bonum sibi ipsi; ut sic dilectio proximi sit vera. Nam cum quis diligit proximum propter suam utilitatem vel delectationem, non vere diligit proximum, sed seipsum.
        
The mode of love is indicated in the words "as thyself." This does not mean that a man must love his neighbor equally as himself, but in like manner as himself, and this in three ways. First, as regards the end, namely, that he should love his neighbor for God's sake, even as he loves himself for God's sake, so that his love for his neighbor is a "holy" love. Secondly, as regards the rule of love, namely, that a man should not give way to his neighbor in evil, but only in good things, even as he ought to gratify his will in good things alone, so that his love for his neighbor may be a "righteous" love. Thirdly, as regards the reason for loving, namely, that a man should love his neighbor, not for his own profit, or pleasure, but in the sense of wishing his neighbor well, even as he wishes himself well, so that his love for his neighbor may be a "true" love: since when a man loves his neighbor for his own profit or pleasure, he does not love his neighbor truly, but loves himself.
