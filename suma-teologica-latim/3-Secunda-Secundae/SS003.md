# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod finis fidei, sicut et aliarum virtutum, referri debet ad finem caritatis, qui est amor Dei et proximi. Et ideo quando honor Dei vel utilitas proximi hoc exposcit, non debet esse contentus homo ut per fidem suam ipse veritati divinae coniungatur; sed debet fidem exterius confiteri.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The end of faith, even as of the other virtues, must be referred to the end of charity, which is the love of God and our neighbor. Consequently when God's honor and our neighbor's good demand, man should not be contented with being united by faith to God's truth, but ought to confess his faith outwardly.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in casu necessitatis, ubi fides periclitatur, quilibet tenetur fidem suam aliis propalare, vel ad instructionem aliorum fidelium sive confirmationem, vel ad reprimendum infidelium insultationem. Sed aliis temporibus instruere homines de fide non pertinet ad omnes fideles.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 In cases of necessity where faith is in danger, every one is bound to proclaim his faith to others, either to give good example and encouragement to the rest of the faithful, or to check the attacks of unbelievers: but at other times it is not the duty of all the faithful to instruct others in the faith.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, si turbatio infidelium oriatur de confessione fidei manifesta absque aliqua utilitate fidei vel fidelium, non est laudabile in tali casu fidem publice confiteri, unde dominus dicit, Matth. VII, nolite sanctum dare canibus, neque margaritas vestras spargere ante porcos, ne conversi dirumpant vos. Sed si utilitas aliqua fidei speretur aut necessitas adsit, contempta turbatione infidelium, debet homo fidem publice confiteri. Unde Matth. XV dicitur quod, cum discipuli dixissent domino quod Pharisaei, audito eius verbo, scandalizati sunt, dominus respondit, sinite illos, scilicet turbari, caeci sunt et duces caecorum.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 There is nothing commendable in making a public confession of one's faith, if it causes a disturbance among unbelievers, without any profit either to the faith or to the faithful. Hence Our Lord said (
Mt. 7:6
): "Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine... lest turning upon you, they tear you." Yet, if there is hope of profit to the faith, or if there be urgency, a man should disregard the disturbance of unbelievers, and confess his faith in public. Hence it is written (
Mt. 15:12
) that when the disciples had said to Our Lord that "the Pharisee, when they heard this word, were scandalized," He answered: "Let them alone, they are blind, and leaders of the blind."
