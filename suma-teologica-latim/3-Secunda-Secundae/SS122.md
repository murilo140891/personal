# Summa Theologica

Praeterea, praecepta Decalogi distinguuntur in duas tabulas secundum dilectionem Dei et proximi, quae pertinent ad virtutem caritatis. Ergo praecepta Decalogi magis pertinent ad caritatem quam ad iustitiam.
        
Objection 4:
 Further, the precepts of the decalogue are divided into two tables, corresponding to the love of God and the love of our neighbor, both of which regard the virtue of charity. Therefore the precepts of the decalogue belong to charity rather than to justice.




Sed contra est quod iustitia sola videtur esse virtus per quam ordinamur ad alterum. Sed per omnia praecepta Decalogi ordinamur ad alterum, ut patet discurrenti per singula. Ergo omnia praecepta Decalogi pertinent ad iustitiam.
        
On the contrary,
 Seemingly justice is the sole virtue whereby we are directed to another. Now we are directed to another by all the precepts of the decalogue, as is evident if one consider each of them. Therefore all the precepts of the decalogue pertain to justice.




Respondeo dicendum quod praecepta Decalogi sunt prima praecepta legis, et quibus statim ratio naturalis assentit sicut manifestissimis. Manifestissime autem ratio debiti, quae requiritur ad praeceptum, apparet in iustitia, quae est ad alterum, quia in his quae spectant ad seipsum, videtur primo aspectui quod homo sit sui dominus, et quod liceat ei facere quodlibet; sed in his quae sunt ad alterum, manifeste apparet quod homo est alteri obligatus ad reddendum ei quod debet. Et ideo praecepta Decalogi oportuit ad iustitiam pertinere. Unde tria prima praecepta sunt de actibus religionis, quae est potissima pars iustitiae; quartum autem praeceptum est de actu pietatis, quae est pars iustitiae secunda; alia vero sex dantur de actibus iustitiae communiter dictae, quae inter aequales attenditur.
        
I answer that,
 The precepts of the decalogue are the first principles of the Law: and the natural reason assents to them at once, as to principles that are most evident. Now it is altogether evident that the notion of duty, which is essential to a precept, appears in justice, which is of one towards another. Because in those matters that relate to himself it would seem at a glance that man is master of himself, and that he may do as he likes: whereas in matters that refer to another it appears manifestly that a man is under obligation to render to another that which is his due. Hence the precepts of the decalogue must needs pertain to justice. Wherefore the first three precepts are about acts of religion, which is the chief part of justice; the fourth precept is about acts of piety, which is the second part of justice; and the six remaining are about justice commonly so called, which is observed among equals.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod lex intendit omnes homines facere virtuosos, sed ordine quodam, ut scilicet prius tradat eis praecepta de his in quibus est manifestior ratio debiti, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The intention of the law is to make all men virtuous, but in a certain order, namely, by first of all giving them precepts about those things where the notion of duty is most manifest, as stated above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod iudicialia praecepta sunt quaedam determinationes moralium praeceptorum prout ordinantur ad proximum, sicut et caeremonialia sunt quaedam determinationes moralium praeceptorum prout ordinantur ad Deum. Unde neutra praecepta continentur in Decalogo. Sunt tamen determinationes praeceptorum Decalogi. Et sic ad iustitiam pertinent.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The judicial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts, in so far as these are directed to one's neighbor, just as the ceremonial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts in so far as these are directed to God. Hence neither precepts are contained in the decalogue: and yet they are determinations of the precepts of the decalogue, and therefore pertain to justice.




Ad tertium dicendum quod ea quae pertinent ad bonum commune oportet diversimode dispensari secundum hominum diversitatem. Et ideo non fuerunt ponenda inter praecepta Decalogi, sed inter praecepta iudicialia.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Things that concern the common good must needs be administered in different ways according to the difference of men. Hence they were to be given a place not among the precepts of the decalogue, but among the judicial precepts.




Ad quartum dicendum quod praecepta Decalogi pertinent ad caritatem sicut ad finem, secundum illud I ad Tim. I, finis praecepti caritas est. Sed ad iustitiam pertinent inquantum immediate sunt de actibus iustitiae.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 The precepts of the decalogue pertain to charity as their end, according to 1 Tim. 1:5, "The end of the commandment is charity": but they belong to justice, inasmuch as they refer immediately to acts of justice.

Sed contra est quod iustitia sola videtur esse virtus per quam ordinamur ad alterum. Sed per omnia praecepta Decalogi ordinamur ad alterum, ut patet discurrenti per singula. Ergo omnia praecepta Decalogi pertinent ad iustitiam.
        
On the contrary,
 Seemingly justice is the sole virtue whereby we are directed to another. Now we are directed to another by all the precepts of the decalogue, as is evident if one consider each of them. Therefore all the precepts of the decalogue pertain to justice.

Et ideo praecepta Decalogi oportuit ad iustitiam pertinere. Unde tria prima praecepta sunt de actibus religionis, quae est potissima pars iustitiae; quartum autem praeceptum est de actu pietatis, quae est pars iustitiae secunda; alia vero sex dantur de actibus iustitiae communiter dictae, quae inter aequales attenditur.
