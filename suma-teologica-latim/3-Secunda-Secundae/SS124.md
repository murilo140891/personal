Quinto, de causa.
        


(5)
 Its cause.

Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus ibidem dicit, esset possibile quod aliquibus fide dignis testificationibus divina persuasit auctoritas Ecclesiae ut dictarum sanctarum memoriam honoraret.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i) that "possibly the Church was induced by certain credible witnesses of Divine authority thus to honor the memory of those holy women [*Cf. Question [64], Article [1], ad 2]."




Ad tertium dicendum quod praecepta legis dantur de actibus virtutis. Dictum autem est supra quaedam praecepta legis divinae tradita esse secundum praeparationem animi, ut scilicet homo sit paratus hoc vel illud faciendi cum fuerit opportunum. Ita etiam et aliqua pertinent ad actum virtutis secundum animi praeparationem, ut scilicet, superveniente tali casu, homo secundum rationem agat. Et hoc praecipue videtur observandum in martyrio, quod consistit in debita sustinentia passionum iniuste inflictarum, non autem debet homo occasionem dare alteri iniuste agendi, sed si alius iniuste egerit, ipse debet moderate tolerare.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The precepts of the Law are about acts of virtue. Now it has been stated (
FS
, 
Question [108]
, 
Article [1]
, ad 4) that some of the precepts of the Divine Law are to be understood in reference to the preparation of the mind, in the sense that man ought to be prepared to do such and such a thing, whenever expedient. In the same way certain things belong to an act of virtue as regards the preparation of the mind, so that in such and such a case a man should act according to reason. And this observation would seem very much to the point in the case of martyrdom, which consists in the right endurance of sufferings unjustly inflicted. Nor ought a man to give another an occasion of acting unjustly: yet if anyone act unjustly, one ought to endure it in moderation.
