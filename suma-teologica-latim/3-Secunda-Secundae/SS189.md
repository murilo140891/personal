# Summa Theologica

Ad quintum dicendum quod praeceptorum quaedam sunt principalia, quae sunt fines et praeceptorum et consiliorum, scilicet praecepta caritatis. Ad quae consilia ordinantur, non ita quod sine consiliis servari non possint, sed ut per consilia perfectius observentur. Alia vero sunt praecepta secundaria, quae ordinantur ad praecepta caritatis ut sine quibus caritatis praecepta observari non possunt omnino. Sic igitur perfecta observantia praeceptorum caritatis praecedit intentione consilia, sed interdum tempore sequitur. Hic est enim ordo finis respectu eorum quae sunt ad finem. Observantia vero praeceptorum caritatis secundum communem modum, et similiter alia praecepta, comparantur ad consilia sicut commune ad proprium, quia observantia praeceptorum potest esse sine consiliis, sed non convertitur. Sic ergo observantia praeceptorum communiter sumpta, praecedit naturae ordine consilia, non tamen oportet quod tempore, quia non est aliquid prius in genere quam sit in aliqua specierum. Observantia vero praeceptorum sine consiliis ordinatur ad observantiam praeceptorum cum consiliis sicut species imperfecta ad perfectam, sicut animal irrationale ad rationale. Perfectum autem est naturaliter prius imperfecto, natura enim, ut Boetius dicit, a perfectis sumit initium. Nec tamen oportet quod prius observentur praecepta sine consiliis et postea cum consiliis, sicut non oportet quod aliquis prius sit asinus quam sit homo, vel quod prius sit coniugatus quam sit virgo. Et similiter non oportet quod aliquis prius servet praecepta in saeculo quam transeat ad religionem, praesertim quia conversatio saecularis non disponit ad perfectionem religionis, sed magis impedit.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 There are certain chief precepts which are the ends, so to say, of the commandments and counsels. These are the precepts of charity, and the counsels are directed to them, not that these precepts cannot be observed without keeping the counsels, but that the keeping of the counsels conduces to the better observance of the precepts. The other precepts are secondary and are directed to the precepts of charity; in such a way that unless one observe them it is altogether impossible to keep the precepts of charity. Accordingly in the intention the perfect observance of the precepts of charity precedes the counsels, and yet sometimes it follows them in point of time. For such is the order of the end in relation to things directed to the end. But the observance in a general way of the precepts of charity together with the other precepts, is compared to the counsels as the common to the proper, because one can observe the precepts without observing the counsels, but not vice versa. Hence the common observance of the precepts precedes the counsels in the order of nature; but it does not follow that it precedes them in point of time, for a thing is not in the genus before being in one of the species. But the observance of the precepts apart from the counsels is directed to the observance of the precepts together with the counsels; as an imperfect to a perfect species, even as the irrational to the rational animal. Now the perfect is naturally prior to the imperfect, since "nature," as Boethius says (De Consol. iii, 10), "begins with perfect things." And yet it is not necessary for the precepts first of all to be observed without the counsels, and afterwards with the counsels, just as it is not necessary for one to be an ass before being a man, or married before being a virgin. In like manner it is not necessary for a person first of all to keep the commandments in the world before entering religion; especially as the worldly life does not dispose one to religious perfection, but is more an obstacle thereto.

Filius autem non tenetur ad aliquod speciale debitum patri, nisi forte in casu necessitatis, ut dictum est.
        
On the other hand, he does not owe his father a special debt, except as may arise in a case of necessity, as stated above.

Ad tertium dicendum quod votum solemne quo quis obligatur minori religioni, est fortius quam votum simplex quo quis adstringitur maiori religioni, post votum enim simplex, si contraheret aliquis matrimonium, non dirimeretur, sicut post votum solemne. Et ideo ille qui iam professus est in minori religione, non tenetur implere votum simplex quod emisit de intrando maiorem religionem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The solemn vow whereby a person is bound to a less strict order, is more binding than the simple vow whereby a person is bound to a stricter order. For if after taking a simple vow a person were to be married, his marriage would not be invalid, as it would be after his taking a solemn vow. Consequently a person who is professed in a less severe order is not bound to fulfil a simple vow he has taken on entering a more severe order.

Exemplum autem illud quod inducitur de David, non facit ad propositum. Quia arma Saulis, sicut Glossa dicit, sunt legis sacramenta, tanquam onerantia, religio autem est suave iugum Christi, quia, ut Gregorius dicit, in IV Moral., quid grave mentis nostrae cervicibus imponit qui vitare omne desiderium quod perturbat praecipit, qui declinari laboriosa mundi huius itinera monet?
        
The example quoted of David is not to the point, because "the arms of Saul," as a gloss on the passage observes, "are the sacraments of the Law, as being burdensome": whereas religion is the sweet yoke of Christ, for as Gregory says (Moral. iv, 33), "what burden does He lay on the shoulders of the mind, Who commands us to shun all troublesome desires, Who warns us to turn aside from the rough paths of this world?"




Quod quidem suave iugum super se tollentibus refectionem divinae fruitionis repromittit, et sempiternam requiem animarum.
        
To those indeed who take this sweet yoke upon themselves He promises the refreshment of the divine fruition and the eternal rest of their souls.




Ad quam nos perducat ipse qui promisit, Iesus Christus, dominus noster, qui est super omnia Deus benedictus in saecula. Amen.
        
To which may He Who made this promise bring us, Jesus Christ our Lord, "Who is over all things God blessed for ever. Amen."
