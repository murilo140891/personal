# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod Deus, secundum substantiam suam consideratus, in quocumque sit, aequalis est, quia non minuitur per hoc quod est in aliquo. Sed tamen non aequaliter habet proximus bonitatem Dei sicut habet ipsam Deus, nam Deus habet ipsam essentialiter, proximus autem participative.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Considered in His substance, God is equally in all, in whomsoever He may be, for He is not lessened by being in anything. And yet our neighbor does not possess God's goodness equally with God, for God has it essentially, and our neighbor by participation.

Et ideo ex caritate magis debet homo diligere Deum, qui est bonum commune omnium, quam seipsum, quia beatitudo est in Deo sicut in communi et fontali omnium principio qui beatitudinem participare possunt.
        
Therefore man ought, out of charity, to love God, Who is the common good of all, more than himself: since happiness is in God as in the universal and fountain principle of all who are able to have a share of that happiness.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod philosophus loquitur de amicabilibus quae sunt ad alterum in quo bonum quod est obiectum amicitiae invenitur secundum aliquem particularem modum, non autem de amicabilibus quae sunt ad alterum in quo bonum praedictum invenitur secundum rationem totius.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The Philosopher is speaking of friendly relations towards another person in whom the good, which is the object of friendship, resides in some restricted way; and not of friendly relations with another in whom the aforesaid good resides in totality.




Ad secundum dicendum quod bonum totius diligit quidem pars secundum quod est sibi conveniens, non autem ita quod bonum totius ad se referat, sed potius ita quod seipsam refert in bonum totius.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The part does indeed love the good of the whole, as becomes a part, not however so as to refer the good of the whole to itself, but rather itself to the good of the whole.




Ad tertium dicendum quod hoc quod aliquis velit frui Deo, pertinet ad amorem quo Deus amatur amore concupiscentiae. Magis autem amamus Deum amore amicitiae quam amore concupiscentiae, quia maius est in se bonum Dei quam participare possumus fruendo ipso. Et ideo simpliciter homo magis diligit Deum ex caritate quam seipsum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 That a man wishes to enjoy God pertains to that love of God which is love of concupiscence. Now we love God with the love of friendship more than with the love of concupiscence, because the Divine good is greater in itself, than our share of good in enjoying Him. Hence, out of charity, man simply loves God more than himself.

Respondeo dicendum quod illud magis est ex caritate diligendum quod habet pleniorem rationem diligibilis ex caritate, ut dictum est. Consociatio autem in plena participatione beatitudinis, quae est ratio diligendi proximum, est maior ratio diligendi quam participatio beatitudinis per redundantiam, quae est ratio diligendi proprium corpus. Et ideo proximum, quantum ad salutem animae, magis debemus diligere quam proprium corpus.
        


I answer that,
 Out of charity we ought to love more that which has more fully the reason for being loved out of charity, as stated above (
Article [2]
; 
Question [25]
, 
Article [12]
). Now fellowship in the full participation of happiness which is the reason for loving one's neighbor, is a greater reason for loving, than the participation of happiness by way of overflow, which is the reason for loving one's own body. Therefore, as regards the welfare of the soul we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod quia, secundum philosophum, in IX Ethic., unumquodque videtur esse id quod est praecipuum in ipso; cum dicitur proximus esse magis diligendus quam proprium corpus, intelligitur hoc quantum ad animam, quae est potior pars eius.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8) a thing seems to be that which is predominant in it: so that when we say that we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body, this refers to his soul, which is his predominant part.




Ad secundum dicendum quod corpus nostrum est propinquius animae nostrae quam proximus quantum ad constitutionem propriae naturae. Sed quantum ad participationem beatitudinis maior est consociatio animae proximi ad animam nostram quam etiam corporis proprii.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Our body is nearer to our soul than our neighbor, as regards the constitution of our own nature: but as regards the participation of happiness, our neighbor's soul is more closely associated with our own soul, than even our own body is.




Ad tertium dicendum quod cuilibet homini imminet cura proprii corporis, non autem imminet cuilibet homini cura de salute proximi, nisi forte in casu. Et ideo non est de necessitate caritatis quod homo proprium corpus exponat pro salute proximi, nisi in casu quod tenetur eius saluti providere. Sed quod aliquis sponte ad hoc se offerat, pertinet ad perfectionem caritatis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Every man is immediately concerned with the care of his own body, but not with his neighbor's welfare, except perhaps in cases of urgency: wherefore charity does not necessarily require a man to imperil his own body for his neighbor's welfare, except in a case where he is under obligation to do so and if a man of his own accord offer himself for that purpose, this belongs to the perfection of charity.

Sed per se loquendo, pater magis est amandus quam mater. Amantur enim pater et mater ut principia quaedam naturalis originis. Pater autem habet excellentiorem rationem principii quam mater, quia pater est principium per modum agentis, mater autem magis per modum patientis et materiae. Et ideo, per se loquendo, pater est magis diligendus.
        
Strictly speaking, however, the father should be loved more than the mother. For father and mother are loved as principles of our natural origin. Now the father is principle in a more excellent way than the mother, because he is the active principle, while the mother is a passive and material principle. Consequently, strictly speaking, the father is to be loved more.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod in generatione hominis mater ministrat materiam corporis informem, formatur autem per virtutem formativam quae est in semine patris. Et quamvis huiusmodi virtus non possit creare animam rationalem, disponit tamen materiam corporalem ad huiusmodi formae susceptionem.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 In the begetting of man, the mother supplies the formless matter of the body; and the latter receives its form through the formative power that is in the semen of the father. And though this power cannot create the rational soul, yet it disposes the matter of the body to receive that form.




Ad secundum dicendum quod hoc pertinet ad aliam rationem dilectionis, alia enim est species amicitiae qua diligimus amantem, et qua diligimus generantem. Nunc autem loquimur de amicitia quae debetur patri et matri secundum generationis rationem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This applies to another kind of love. For the friendship between lover and lover differs specifically from the friendship between child and parent: while the friendship we are speaking of here, is that which a man owes his father and mother through being begotten of them.

The Reply to the Third Objection is evident.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod quantum ad coniunctos sibi ratio illa concedenda est. Sed quantum ad seipsum oportet quod aliquis plus se quam alios diligat, tanto magis quanto perfectior est caritas, quia perfectio caritatis ordinat hominem perfecte in Deum quod pertinet ad dilectionem sui ipsius, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument should be granted as to those who are connected together; but as regards man himself, he ought to love himself so much the more than others, as his charity is more perfect, since perfect entire reason of his love, for God is man's charity directs man to God perfectly, and this belongs to love of oneself, as stated above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de ordine dilectionis secundum gradum boni quod aliquis vult amato.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This argument considers the order of charity in respect of the degree of good one wills the person one loves.




Ad tertium dicendum quod unicuique erit Deus tota ratio diligendi eo quod Deus est totum hominis bonum, dato enim, per impossibile, quod Deus non esset hominis bonum, non esset ei ratio diligendi. Et ideo in ordine dilectionis oportet quod post Deum homo maxime diligat seipsum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 God will be to each one the entire reason of his love, for God is man's entire good. For if we make the impossible supposition that God were not man's good, He would not be man's reason for loving. Hence it is that in the order of love man should love himself more than all else after God.
