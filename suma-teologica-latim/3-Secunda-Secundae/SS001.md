# Summa Theologica

Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod obiectum fidei non sit veritas prima. Illud enim videtur esse obiectum fidei quod nobis proponitur ad credendum. Sed non solum proponuntur nobis ad credendum ea quae pertinent ad divinitatem, quae est veritas prima; sed etiam ea quae pertinent ad humanitatem Christi et Ecclesiae sacramenta et creaturarum conditionem. Ergo non solum veritas prima est fidei obiectum.
        
Objection 1:
 It would seem that the object of faith is not the First Truth. For it seems that the object of faith is that which is proposed to us to be believed. Now not only things pertaining to the Godhead, i.e. the First Truth, are proposed to us to be believed, but also things concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of the Church, and the condition of creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the First Truth.




Praeterea, fides et infidelitas sunt circa idem, cum sint opposita. Sed circa omnia quae in sacra Scriptura continentur potest esse infidelitas, quidquid enim horum homo negaverit, infidelis reputatur. Ergo etiam fides est circa omnia quae in sacra Scriptura continentur. Sed ibi multa continentur de hominibus et de aliis rebus creatis. Ergo obiectum fidei non solum est veritas prima, sed etiam veritas creata.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, faith and unbelief have the same object since they are opposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things contained in Holy Writ, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is considered an unbeliever. Therefore faith also is about all things contained in Holy Writ. But there are many things therein, concerning man and other creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the First Truth, but also created truth.




Praeterea, fides caritati condividitur, ut supra dictum est. Sed caritate non solum diligimus Deum, qui est summa bonitas, sed etiam diligimus proximum. Ergo fidei obiectum non est solum veritas prima.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, faith is condivided with charity, as stated above (FS, Question [62], Article [3]). Now by charity we love not only God, who is the sovereign Good, but also our neighbor. Therefore the object of Faith is not only the First Truth.




Sed contra est quod Dionysius dicit, VII cap. de Div. Nom., quod fides est circa simplicem et semper existentem veritatem. Haec autem est veritas prima. Ergo obiectum fidei est veritas prima.
        
On the contrary,
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "faith is about the simple and everlasting truth." Now this is the First Truth. Therefore the object of faith is the First Truth.




Respondeo dicendum quod cuiuslibet cognoscitivi habitus obiectum duo habet, scilicet id quod materialiter cognoscitur, quod est sicut materiale obiectum; et id per quod cognoscitur, quod est formalis ratio obiecti. Sicut in scientia geometriae materialiter scita sunt conclusiones; formalis vero ratio sciendi sunt media demonstrationis, per quae conclusiones cognoscuntur.
        
I answer that,
 The object of every cognitive habit includes two things: first, that which is known materially, and is the material object, so to speak, and, secondly, that whereby it is known, which is the formal aspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the conclusions are what is known materially, while the formal aspect of the science is the mean of demonstration, through which the conclusions are known.




Sic igitur in fide, si consideremus formalem rationem obiecti, nihil est aliud quam veritas prima, non enim fides de qua loquimur assentit alicui nisi quia est a Deo revelatum; unde ipsi veritati divinae innititur tanquam medio. Si vero consideremus materialiter ea quibus fides assentit, non solum est ipse Deus, sed etiam multa alia. Quae tamen sub assensu fidei non cadunt nisi secundum quod habent aliquem ordinem ad Deum, prout scilicet per aliquos divinitatis effectus homo adiuvatur ad tendendum in divinam fruitionem. Et ideo etiam ex hac parte obiectum fidei est quodammodo veritas prima, inquantum nihil cadit sub fide nisi in ordine ad Deum, sicut etiam obiectum medicinae est sanitas, quia nihil medicina considerat nisi in ordine ad sanitatem.
        
Accordingly if we consider, in faith, the formal aspect of the object, it is nothing else than the First Truth. For the faith of which we are speaking, does not assent to anything, except because it is revealed by God. Hence the mean on which faith is based is the Divine Truth. If, however, we consider materially the things to which faith assents, they include not only God, but also many other things, which, nevertheless, do not come under the assent of faith, except as bearing some relation to God, in as much as, to wit, through certain effects of the Divine operation, man is helped on his journey towards the enjoyment of God. Consequently from this point of view also the object of faith is, in a way, the First Truth, in as much as nothing comes under faith except in relation to God, even as the object of the medical art is health, for it considers nothing save in relation to health.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ea quae pertinent ad humanitatem Christi et ad sacramenta Ecclesiae vel ad quascumque creaturas cadunt sub fide inquantum per haec ordinamur ad Deum. Et eis etiam assentimus propter divinam veritatem.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Things concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of the Church, or any creatures whatever, come under faith, in so far as by them we are directed to God, and in as much as we assent to them on account of the Divine Truth.




Et similiter dicendum est ad secundum, de omnibus illis quae in sacra Scriptura traduntur.
        
The same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all things contained in Holy Writ.




Ad tertium dicendum quod etiam caritas diligit proximum propter Deum; et sic obiectum eius proprie est ipse Deus, ut infra dicetur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Charity also loves our neighbor on account of God, so that its object, properly speaking, is God, as we shall show further on (

Question [25]
, 
Article [1]
).

Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod obiectum fidei non sit aliquid complexum per modum enuntiabilis. Obiectum enim fidei est veritas prima, sicut dictum est. Sed prima veritas est aliquid incomplexum. Ergo obiectum fidei non est aliquid complexum.
        


Objection 1:
 It would seem that the object of faith is not something complex by way of a proposition. For the object of faith is the First Truth, as stated above (
Article [1]
). Now the First Truth is something simple. Therefore the object of faith is not something complex.




Praeterea, expositio fidei in symbolo continetur. Sed in symbolo non ponuntur enuntiabilia, sed res, non enim dicitur ibi quod Deus sit omnipotens, sed, credo in Deum omnipotentem. Ergo obiectum fidei non est enuntiabile, sed res.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, the exposition of faith is contained in the symbol. Now the symbol does not contain propositions, but things: for it is not stated therein that God is almighty, but: "I believe in God... almighty." Therefore the object of faith is not a proposition but a thing.




Praeterea, fidei succedit visio, secundum illud I ad Cor. XIII, videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem. Sed visio patriae est de incomplexo, cum sit ipsius divinae essentiae. Ergo etiam fides viae.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, faith is succeeded by vision, according to 1 Cor. 13:12: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known." But the object of the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is the Divine Essence. Therefore the faith of the wayfarer is also.




Sed contra, fides est media inter scientiam et opinionem. Medium autem et extrema sunt eiusdem generis. Cum igitur scientia et opinio sint circa enuntiabilia, videtur quod similiter fides sit circa enuntiabilia. Et ita obiectum fidei, cum fides sit circa enuntiabilia, est aliquid complexum.
        
On the contrary,
 Faith is a mean between science and opinion. Now the mean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science and opinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is likewise about propositions; so that its object is something complex.




Respondeo dicendum quod cognita sunt in cognoscente secundum modum cognoscentis. Est autem modus proprius humani intellectus ut componendo et dividendo veritatem cognoscat, sicut in primo dictum est. Et ideo ea quae sunt secundum se simplicia intellectus humanus cognoscit secundum quandam complexionem, sicut e converso intellectus divinus incomplexe cognoscit ea quae sunt secundum se complexa.
        
I answer that,
 The thing known is in the knower according to the mode of the knower. Now the mode proper to the human intellect is to know the truth by synthesis and analysis, as stated in the FP, Question [85], Article [5]. Hence things that are simple in themselves, are known by the intellect with a certain amount of complexity, just as on the other hand, the Divine intellect knows, without any complexity, things that are complex in themselves.




Sic igitur obiectum fidei dupliciter considerari potest. Uno modo, ex parte ipsius rei creditae, et sic obiectum fidei est aliquid incomplexum, scilicet res ipsa de qua fides habetur. Alio modo, ex parte credentis, et secundum hoc obiectum fidei est aliquid complexum per modum enuntiabilis.
        
Accordingly the object of faith may be considered in two ways. First, as regards the thing itself which is believed, and thus the object of faith is something simple, namely the thing itself about which we have faith. Secondly, on the part of the believer, and in this respect the object of faith is something complex by way of a proposition.




Et ideo utrumque vere opinatum fuit apud antiquos, et secundum aliquid utrumque est verum.
        
Hence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount of truth.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de obiecto fidei ex parte ipsius rei creditae.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument considers the object of faith on the part of the thing believed.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in symbolo tanguntur ea de quibus est fides inquantum ad ea terminatur actus credentis, ut ex ipso modo loquendi apparet. Actus autem credentis non terminatur ad enuntiabile, sed ad rem, non enim formamus enuntiabilia nisi ut per ea de rebus cognitionem habeamus, sicut in scientia, ita et in fide.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The symbol mentions the things about which faith is, in so far as the act of the believer is terminated in them, as is evident from the manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the believer does not terminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as in science we do not form propositions, except in order to have knowledge about things through their means, so is it in faith.




Ad tertium dicendum quod visio patriae erit veritatis primae secundum quod in se est, secundum illud I Ioan. III, cum apparuerit, similes ei erimus et videbimus eum sicuti est. Et ideo visio illa erit non per modum enuntiabilis, sed per modum simplicis intelligentiae. Sed per fidem non apprehendimus veritatem primam sicut in se est. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The object of the heavenly vision will be the First Truth seen in itself, according to 1 Jn. 3:2: "We know that when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as He is": hence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way of a simple understanding. On the other hand, by faith, we do not apprehend the First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison fails.

Praeterea, expositio fidei in symbolo continetur. Sed in symbolo non ponuntur enuntiabilia, sed res, non enim dicitur ibi quod Deus sit omnipotens, sed, credo in Deum omnipotentem. Ergo obiectum fidei non est enuntiabile, sed res.

Sic igitur obiectum fidei dupliciter considerari potest. Uno modo, ex parte ipsius rei creditae, et sic obiectum fidei est aliquid incomplexum, scilicet res ipsa de qua fides habetur. Alio modo, ex parte credentis, et secundum hoc obiectum fidei est aliquid complexum per modum enuntiabilis.
        
Accordingly the object of faith may be considered in two ways. First, as regards the thing itself which is believed, and thus the object of faith is something simple, namely the thing itself about which we have faith. Secondly, on the part of the believer, and in this respect the object of faith is something complex by way of a proposition.




Et ideo utrumque vere opinatum fuit apud antiquos, et secundum aliquid utrumque est verum.
        
Hence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount of truth.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de obiecto fidei ex parte ipsius rei creditae.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument considers the object of faith on the part of the thing believed.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in symbolo tanguntur ea de quibus est fides inquantum ad ea terminatur actus credentis, ut ex ipso modo loquendi apparet. Actus autem credentis non terminatur ad enuntiabile, sed ad rem, non enim formamus enuntiabilia nisi ut per ea de rebus cognitionem habeamus, sicut in scientia, ita et in fide.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The symbol mentions the things about which faith is, in so far as the act of the believer is terminated in them, as is evident from the manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the believer does not terminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as in science we do not form propositions, except in order to have knowledge about things through their means, so is it in faith.




Ad tertium dicendum quod visio patriae erit veritatis primae secundum quod in se est, secundum illud I Ioan. III, cum apparuerit, similes ei erimus et videbimus eum sicuti est. Et ideo visio illa erit non per modum enuntiabilis, sed per modum simplicis intelligentiae. Sed per fidem non apprehendimus veritatem primam sicut in se est. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The object of the heavenly vision will be the First Truth seen in itself, according to 1 Jn. 3:2: "We know that when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as He is": hence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way of a simple understanding. On the other hand, by faith, we do not apprehend the First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison fails.

Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod obiectum fidei sit aliquid visum. Dicit enim dominus Thomae, Ioan. XX, quia vidisti me, credidisti. Ergo et de eodem est visio et fides.
        


Objection 1:
 It would seem that the object of faith is something seen. For Our Lord said to Thomas (
Jn. 20:29
): "Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed." Therefore vision and faith regard the same object.




Praeterea, apostolus, I ad Cor. XIII, dicit, videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate. Et loquitur de cognitione fidei. Ergo id quod creditur videtur.
        


Objection 2:
 Further, the Apostle, while speaking of the knowledge of faith, says (
1 Cor. 13:12
): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner." Therefore what is believed is seen.




Praeterea, fides est quoddam spirituale lumen. Sed quolibet lumine aliquid videtur. Ergo fides est de rebus visis.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, faith is a spiritual light. Now something is seen under every light. Therefore faith is of things seen.




Praeterea, quilibet sensus visus nominatur, ut Augustinus dicit, in libro de Verb. Dom. Sed fides est de auditis, secundum illud ad Rom. X, fides ex auditu. Ergo fides est de rebus visis.
        
Objection 4:
 Further, "Every sense is a kind of sight," as Augustine states (De Verb. Domini, Serm. xxxiii). But faith is of things heard, according to Rm. 10:17: "Faith... cometh by hearing." Therefore faith is of things seen.




Sed contra est quod apostolus dicit, ad Heb. XI, quod fides est argumentum non apparentium.
        


On the contrary,
 The Apostle says (
Heb. 11:1
) that "faith is the evidence of things that appear not."
      


Respondeo dicendum quod fides importat assensum intellectus ad id quod creditur. Assentit autem alicui intellectus dupliciter. Uno modo, quia ad hoc movetur ab ipso obiecto, quod est vel per seipsum cognitum, sicut patet in principiis primis, quorum est intellectus; vel est per aliud cognitum, sicut patet de conclusionibus, quarum est scientia. Alio modo intellectus assentit alicui non quia sufficienter moveatur ab obiecto proprio, sed per quandam electionem voluntarie declinans in unam partem magis quam in aliam. Et si quidem hoc fit cum dubitatione et formidine alterius partis, erit opinio, si autem fit cum certitudine absque tali formidine, erit fides.
        
I answer that,
 Faith implies assent of the intellect to that which is believed. Now the intellect assents to a thing in two ways. First, through being moved to assent by its very object, which is known either by itself (as in the case of first principles, which are held by the habit of understanding), or through something else already known (as in the case of conclusions which are held by the habit of science). Secondly the intellect assents to something, not through being sufficiently moved to this assent by its proper object, but through an act of choice, whereby it turns voluntarily to one side rather than to the other: and if this be accompanied by doubt or fear of the opposite side, there will be opinion, while, if there be certainty and no fear of the other side, there will be faith.




Illa autem videri dicuntur quae per seipsa movent intellectum nostrum vel sensum ad sui cognitionem. Unde manifestum est quod nec fides nec opinio potest esse de visis aut secundum sensum aut secundum intellectum.
        
Now those things are said to be seen which, of themselves, move the intellect or the senses to knowledge of them. Wherefore it is evident that neither faith nor opinion can be of things seen either by the senses or by the intellect.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Thomas aliud vidit et aliud credidit. Hominem vidit et Deum credens confessus est, cum dixit, dominus meus et Deus meus.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Thomas "saw one thing, and believed another" [*St. Gregory: Hom. xxvi in Evang.]: he saw the Man, and believing Him to be God, he made profession of his faith, saying: "My Lord and my God."




Ad secundum dicendum quod ea quae subsunt fidei dupliciter considerari possunt. Uno modo, in speciali, et sic non possunt esse simul visa et credita, sicut dictum est. Alio modo, in generali, scilicet sub communi ratione credibilis. Et sic sunt visa ab eo qui credit, non enim crederet nisi videret ea esse credenda, vel propter evidentiam signorum vel propter aliquid huiusmodi.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Those things which come under faith can be considered in two ways. First, in particular; and thus they cannot be seen and believed at the same time, as shown above. Secondly, in general, that is, under the common aspect of credibility; and in this way they are seen by the believer. For he would not believe unless, on the evidence of signs, or of something similar, he saw that they ought to be believed.




Ad tertium dicendum quod lumen fidei facit videre ea quae creduntur. Sicut enim per alios habitus virtutum homo videt illud quod est sibi conveniens secundum habitum illum, ita etiam per habitum fidei inclinatur mens hominis ad assentiendum his quae conveniunt rectae fidei et non aliis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The light of faith makes us see what we believe. For just as, by the habits of the other virtues, man sees what is becoming to him in respect of that habit, so, by the habit of faith, the human mind is directed to assent to such things as are becoming to a right faith, and not to assent to others.




Ad quartum dicendum quod auditus est verborum significantium ea quae sunt fidei, non autem est ipsarum rerum de quibus est fides. Et sic non oportet ut huiusmodi res sint visae.

 Hearing is of words signifying what is of faith, but not of the things themselves that are believed; hence it does not follow that these things are seen.

Ad sextum sic proceditur. Videtur quod credibilia non sint per certos articulos distinguenda. Eorum enim omnium quae in sacra Scriptura continentur est fides habenda. Sed illa non possunt reduci ad aliquem certum numerum, propter sui multitudinem. Ergo superfluum videtur articulos fidei distinguere.
        
Objection 1:
 It would seem that those things that are of faith should not be divided into certain articles. For all things contained in Holy Writ are matters of faith. But these, by reason of their multitude, cannot be reduced to a certain number. Therefore it seems superfluous to distinguish certain articles of faith.




Praeterea, materialis distinctio, cum in infinitum fieri possit, est ab arte praetermittenda. Sed formalis ratio obiecti credibilis est una et indivisibilis, ut supra dictum est, scilicet veritas prima, et sic secundum rationem formalem credibilia distingui non possunt. Ergo praetermittenda est credibilium materialis distinctio per articulos.
        


Objection 2:
 Further, material differences can be multiplied indefinitely, and therefore art should take no notice of them. Now the formal aspect of the object of faith is one and indivisible, as stated above (
Article [1]
), viz. the First Truth, so that matters of faith cannot be distinguished in respect of their formal object. Therefore no notice should be taken of a material division of matters of faith into articles.




Praeterea, sicut a quibusdam dicitur, articulus est indivisibilis veritas de Deo arctans nos ad credendum. Sed credere est voluntarium, quia, sicut Augustinus dicit, nullus credit nisi volens. Ergo videtur quod inconvenienter distinguantur credibilia per articulos.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, it has been said by some [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] that "an article is an indivisible truth concerning God, exacting [arctans] our belief." Now belief is a voluntary act, since, as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), "no man believes against his will." Therefore it seems that matters of faith should not be divided into articles.




Sed contra est quod Isidorus dicit, articulus est perceptio divinae veritatis tendens in ipsam. Sed perceptio divinae veritatis competit nobis secundum distinctionem quandam, quae enim in Deo unum sunt in nostro intellectu multiplicantur. Ergo credibilia debent per articulos distingui.
        
On the contrary,
 Isidore says: "An article is a glimpse of Divine truth, tending thereto." Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine truth by way of analysis, since things which in God are one, are manifold in our intellect. Therefore matters of faith should be divided into articles.




Respondeo dicendum quod nomen articuli ex Graeco videtur esse derivatum. Arthron enim in Graeco, quod in Latino articulus dicitur, significat quandam coaptationem aliquarum partium distinctarum. Et ideo particulae corporis sibi invicem coaptatae dicuntur membrorum articuli. Et similiter in grammatica apud Graecos dicuntur articuli quaedam partes orationis coaptatae aliis dictionibus ad exprimendum earum genus, numerum vel casum. Et similiter in rhetorica articuli dicuntur quaedam partium coaptationes, dicit enim Tullius, in IV Rhet., quod articulus dicitur cum singula verba intervallis distinguuntur caesa oratione, hoc modo, acrimonia, voce, vultu adversarios perterruisti.
        
I answer that,
 the word "article" is apparently derived from the Greek; for the Greek {arthron} [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] which the Latin renders "articulus," signifies a fitting together of distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar, articles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit together in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is composed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: "Your passion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes."




Unde et credibilia fidei Christianae dicuntur per articulos distingui inquantum in quasdam partes dividuntur habentes aliquam coaptationem ad invicem. Est autem obiectum fidei aliquid non visum circa divina, ut supra dictum est. Et ideo ubi occurrit aliquid speciali ratione non visum, ibi est specialis articulus, ubi autem multa secundum eandem rationem sunt incognita, ibi non sunt articuli distinguendi. Sicut aliam difficultatem habet ad videndum quod Deus sit passus, et aliam quod mortuus resurrexerit, et ideo distinguitur articulus resurrectionis ab articulo passionis. Sed quod sit passus, mortuus et sepultus, unam et eandem difficultatem habent, ita quod, uno suscepto, non est difficile alia suscipere, et propter hoc omnia haec pertinent ad unum articulum.
        

          Hence matters of Christian faith are said to contain distinct articles, in so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together. Now the object of faith is something unseen in connection with God, as stated above (
Article [4]
). Consequently any matter that, for a special reason, is unseen, is a special article; whereas when several matters are known or not known, under the same aspect, we are not to distinguish various articles. Thus one encounters one difficulty in seeing that God suffered, and another in seeing that He rose again from the dead, wherefore the article of the Resurrection is distinct from the article of the Passion. But that He suffered, died and was buried, present the same difficulty, so that if one be accepted, it is not difficult to accept the others; wherefore all these belong to one article.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod aliqua sunt credibilia de quibus est fides secundum se; aliqua vero sunt credibilia de quibus non est fides secundum se, sed solum in ordine ad alia, sicut etiam in aliis scientiis quaedam proponuntur ut per se intenta, et quaedam ad manifestationem aliorum. Quia vero fides principaliter est de his quae videnda speramus in patria, secundum illud Heb. XI, fides est substantia sperandarum rerum; ideo per se ad fidem pertinent illa quae directe nos ordinant ad vitam aeternam, sicut sunt tres personae, omnipotentia Dei, mysterium incarnationis Christi, et alia huiusmodi. Et secundum ista distinguuntur articuli fidei. Quaedam vero proponuntur in sacra Scriptura ut credenda non quasi principaliter intenta, sed ad praedictorum manifestationem, sicut quod Abraham habuit duos filios, quod ad tactum ossium Elisaei suscitatus est mortuus, et alia huiusmodi, quae narrantur in sacra Scriptura in ordine ad manifestationem divinae maiestatis vel incarnationis Christi. Et secundum talia non oportet articulos distinguere.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Some things are proposed to our belief are in themselves of faith, while others are of faith, not in themselves but only in relation to others: even as in sciences certain propositions are put forward on their own account, while others are put forward in order to manifest others. Now, since the chief object of faith consists in those things which we hope to see, according to Heb. 11:2: "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for," it follows that those things are in themselves of faith, which order us directly to eternal life. Such are the Trinity of Persons in Almighty God [*The Leonine Edition reads: The Three Persons, the omnipotence of God, etc.], the mystery of Christ's Incarnation, and the like: and these are distinct articles of faith. On the other hand certain things in Holy Writ are proposed to our belief, not chiefly on their own account, but for the manifestation of those mentioned above: for instance, that Abraham had two sons, that a dead man rose again at the touch of Eliseus' bones, and the like, which are related in Holy Writ for the purpose of manifesting the Divine mystery or the Incarnation of Christ: and such things should not form distinct articles.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio formalis obiecti fidei potest accipi dupliciter. Uno modo, ex parte ipsius rei creditae. Et sic ratio formalis omnium credibilium est una, scilicet veritas prima. Et ex hac parte articuli non distinguuntur. Alio modo potest accipi formalis ratio credibilium ex parte nostra. Et sic ratio formalis credibilis est ut sit non visum. Et ex hac parte articuli fidei distinguuntur, ut visum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The formal aspect of the object of faith can be taken in two ways: first, on the part of the thing believed, and thus there is one formal aspect of all matters of faith, viz. the First Truth: and from this point of view there is no distinction of articles. Secondly, the formal aspect of matters of faith, can be considered from our point of view; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of faith is that it is something unseen; and from this point of view there are various distinct articles of faith, as we saw above.




Ad tertium dicendum quod illa definitio datur de articulo magis secundum quandam etymologiam nominis prout habet derivationem Latinam, quam secundum eius veram significationem prout a Graeco derivatur. Unde non est magni ponderis. Potest tamen dici quod, licet ad credendum necessitate coactionis nullus arctetur, cum credere sit voluntarium; arctatur tamen necessitate finis, quia accedentem ad Deum oportet credere, et sine fide impossibile est placere Deo, ut apostolus dicit, Heb. XI.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 This definition of an article is taken from an etymology of the word as derived from the Latin, rather than in accordance with its real meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it does not carry much weight. Yet even then it could be said that although faith is exacted of no man by a necessity of coercion, since belief is a voluntary act, yet it is exacted of him by a necessity of end, since "he that cometh to God must believe that He is," and "without faith it is impossible to please God," as the Apostle declares (
Heb. 11:6
).

Praeterea, materialis distinctio, cum in infinitum fieri possit, est ab arte praetermittenda. Sed formalis ratio obiecti credibilis est una et indivisibilis, ut supra dictum est, scilicet veritas prima, et sic secundum rationem formalem credibilia distingui non possunt. Ergo praetermittenda est credibilium materialis distinctio per articulos.
        


Objection 2:
 Further, material differences can be multiplied indefinitely, and therefore art should take no notice of them. Now the formal aspect of the object of faith is one and indivisible, as stated above (
Article [1]
), viz. the First Truth, so that matters of faith cannot be distinguished in respect of their formal object. Therefore no notice should be taken of a material division of matters of faith into articles.




Praeterea, sicut a quibusdam dicitur, articulus est indivisibilis veritas de Deo arctans nos ad credendum. Sed credere est voluntarium, quia, sicut Augustinus dicit, nullus credit nisi volens. Ergo videtur quod inconvenienter distinguantur credibilia per articulos.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, it has been said by some [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] that "an article is an indivisible truth concerning God, exacting [arctans] our belief." Now belief is a voluntary act, since, as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), "no man believes against his will." Therefore it seems that matters of faith should not be divided into articles.




Sed contra est quod Isidorus dicit, articulus est perceptio divinae veritatis tendens in ipsam. Sed perceptio divinae veritatis competit nobis secundum distinctionem quandam, quae enim in Deo unum sunt in nostro intellectu multiplicantur. Ergo credibilia debent per articulos distingui.
        
On the contrary,
 Isidore says: "An article is a glimpse of Divine truth, tending thereto." Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine truth by way of analysis, since things which in God are one, are manifold in our intellect. Therefore matters of faith should be divided into articles.




Respondeo dicendum quod nomen articuli ex Graeco videtur esse derivatum. Arthron enim in Graeco, quod in Latino articulus dicitur, significat quandam coaptationem aliquarum partium distinctarum. Et ideo particulae corporis sibi invicem coaptatae dicuntur membrorum articuli. Et similiter in grammatica apud Graecos dicuntur articuli quaedam partes orationis coaptatae aliis dictionibus ad exprimendum earum genus, numerum vel casum. Et similiter in rhetorica articuli dicuntur quaedam partium coaptationes, dicit enim Tullius, in IV Rhet., quod articulus dicitur cum singula verba intervallis distinguuntur caesa oratione, hoc modo, acrimonia, voce, vultu adversarios perterruisti.
        
I answer that,
 the word "article" is apparently derived from the Greek; for the Greek {arthron} [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] which the Latin renders "articulus," signifies a fitting together of distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar, articles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit together in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is composed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: "Your passion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes."




Unde et credibilia fidei Christianae dicuntur per articulos distingui inquantum in quasdam partes dividuntur habentes aliquam coaptationem ad invicem. Est autem obiectum fidei aliquid non visum circa divina, ut supra dictum est.

Respondeo dicendum quod nomen articuli ex Graeco videtur esse derivatum. Arthron enim in Graeco, quod in Latino articulus dicitur, significat quandam coaptationem aliquarum partium distinctarum. Et ideo particulae corporis sibi invicem coaptatae dicuntur membrorum articuli. Et similiter in grammatica apud Graecos dicuntur articuli quaedam partes orationis coaptatae aliis dictionibus ad exprimendum earum genus, numerum vel casum. Et similiter in rhetorica articuli dicuntur quaedam partium coaptationes, dicit enim Tullius, in IV Rhet., quod articulus dicitur cum singula verba intervallis distinguuntur caesa oratione, hoc modo, acrimonia, voce, vultu adversarios perterruisti.
        
I answer that,
 the word "article" is apparently derived from the Greek; for the Greek {arthron} [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] which the Latin renders "articulus," signifies a fitting together of distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar, articles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit together in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is composed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: "Your passion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes."




Unde et credibilia fidei Christianae dicuntur per articulos distingui inquantum in quasdam partes dividuntur habentes aliquam coaptationem ad invicem. Est autem obiectum fidei aliquid non visum circa divina, ut supra dictum est. Et ideo ubi occurrit aliquid speciali ratione non visum, ibi est specialis articulus, ubi autem multa secundum eandem rationem sunt incognita, ibi non sunt articuli distinguendi. Sicut aliam difficultatem habet ad videndum quod Deus sit passus, et aliam quod mortuus resurrexerit, et ideo distinguitur articulus resurrectionis ab articulo passionis. Sed quod sit passus, mortuus et sepultus, unam et eandem difficultatem habent, ita quod, uno suscepto, non est difficile alia suscipere, et propter hoc omnia haec pertinent ad unum articulum.
        

          Hence matters of Christian faith are said to contain distinct articles, in so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together. Now the object of faith is something unseen in connection with God, as stated above (
Article [4]
). Consequently any matter that, for a special reason, is unseen, is a special article; whereas when several matters are known or not known, under the same aspect, we are not to distinguish various articles. Thus one encounters one difficulty in seeing that God suffered, and another in seeing that He rose again from the dead, wherefore the article of the Resurrection is distinct from the article of the Passion. But that He suffered, died and was buried, present the same difficulty, so that if one be accepted, it is not difficult to accept the others; wherefore all these belong to one article.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod aliqua sunt credibilia de quibus est fides secundum se; aliqua vero sunt credibilia de quibus non est fides secundum se, sed solum in ordine ad alia, sicut etiam in aliis scientiis quaedam proponuntur ut per se intenta, et quaedam ad manifestationem aliorum. Quia vero fides principaliter est de his quae videnda speramus in patria, secundum illud Heb. XI, fides est substantia sperandarum rerum; ideo per se ad fidem pertinent illa quae directe nos ordinant ad vitam aeternam, sicut sunt tres personae, omnipotentia Dei, mysterium incarnationis Christi, et alia huiusmodi. Et secundum ista distinguuntur articuli fidei. Quaedam vero proponuntur in sacra Scriptura ut credenda non quasi principaliter intenta, sed ad praedictorum manifestationem, sicut quod Abraham habuit duos filios, quod ad tactum ossium Elisaei suscitatus est mortuus, et alia huiusmodi, quae narrantur in sacra Scriptura in ordine ad manifestationem divinae maiestatis vel incarnationis Christi. Et secundum talia non oportet articulos distinguere.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Some things are proposed to our belief are in themselves of faith, while others are of faith, not in themselves but only in relation to others: even as in sciences certain propositions are put forward on their own account, while others are put forward in order to manifest others. Now, since the chief object of faith consists in those things which we hope to see, according to Heb. 11:2: "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for," it follows that those things are in themselves of faith, which order us directly to eternal life. Such are the Trinity of Persons in Almighty God [*The Leonine Edition reads: The Three Persons, the omnipotence of God, etc.], the mystery of Christ's Incarnation, and the like: and these are distinct articles of faith. On the other hand certain things in Holy Writ are proposed to our belief, not chiefly on their own account, but for the manifestation of those mentioned above: for instance, that Abraham had two sons, that a dead man rose again at the touch of Eliseus' bones, and the like, which are related in Holy Writ for the purpose of manifesting the Divine mystery or the Incarnation of Christ: and such things should not form distinct articles.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio formalis obiecti fidei potest accipi dupliciter. Uno modo, ex parte ipsius rei creditae. Et sic ratio formalis omnium credibilium est una, scilicet veritas prima. Et ex hac parte articuli non distinguuntur. Alio modo potest accipi formalis ratio credibilium ex parte nostra. Et sic ratio formalis credibilis est ut sit non visum. Et ex hac parte articuli fidei distinguuntur, ut visum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The formal aspect of the object of faith can be taken in two ways: first, on the part of the thing believed, and thus there is one formal aspect of all matters of faith, viz. the First Truth: and from this point of view there is no distinction of articles. Secondly, the formal aspect of matters of faith, can be considered from our point of view; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of faith is that it is something unseen; and from this point of view there are various distinct articles of faith, as we saw above.




Ad tertium dicendum quod illa definitio datur de articulo magis secundum quandam etymologiam nominis prout habet derivationem Latinam, quam secundum eius veram significationem prout a Graeco derivatur. Unde non est magni ponderis. Potest tamen dici quod, licet ad credendum necessitate coactionis nullus arctetur, cum credere sit voluntarium; arctatur tamen necessitate finis, quia accedentem ad Deum oportet credere, et sine fide impossibile est placere Deo, ut apostolus dicit, Heb. XI.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 This definition of an article is taken from an etymology of the word as derived from the Latin, rather than in accordance with its real meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it does not carry much weight. Yet even then it could be said that although faith is exacted of no man by a necessity of coercion, since belief is a voluntary act, yet it is exacted of him by a necessity of end, since "he that cometh to God must believe that He is," and "without faith it is impossible to please God," as the Apostle declares (
Heb. 11:6
).

Ad tertium dicendum quod Athanasius non composuit manifestationem fidei per modum symboli, sed magis per modum cuiusdam doctrinae, ut ex ipso modo loquendi apparet. Sed quia integram fidei veritatem eius doctrina breviter continebat, auctoritate summi pontificis est recepta, ut quasi regula fidei habeatur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Athanasius drew up a declaration of faith, not under the form of a symbol, but rather by way of an exposition of doctrine, as appears from his way of speaking. But since it contained briefly the whole truth of faith, it was accepted by the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, so as to be considered as a rule of faith.
