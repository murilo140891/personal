# Summa Theologica

Respondeo dicendum quod, subtracto eo quod dat speciem rei, solvitur species, et res non potest eadem remanere, sicut remota forma corporis naturalis, non remanet idem secundum speciem. Spes autem recipit speciem a suo obiecto principali, sicut et ceterae virtutes, ut ex supradictis patet. Obiectum autem principale eius est beatitudo aeterna secundum quod est possibilis haberi ex auxilio divino, ut supra dictum est.
        


I answer that,
 If what gives a thing its species be removed, the species is destroyed, and that thing cannot remain the same; just as when a natural body loses its form, it does not remain the same specifically. Now hope takes its species from its principal object, even as the other virtues do, as was shown above (
Question [17]
, 
Articles [5]
,6; 
FS
, 
Question [54]
, 
Article [2]
): and its principal object is eternal happiness as being possible to obtain by the assistance of God, as stated above (
Question [17]
, 
Article [2]
).




Quia ergo bonum arduum possibile non cadit sub ratione spei nisi secundum quod est futurum, ideo, cum beatitudo iam non fuerit futura sed praesens, non potest ibi esse virtus spei. Et ideo spes, sicut et fides, evacuatur in patria, et neutrum eorum in beatis esse potest.
        
Since then the arduous possible good cannot be an object of hope except in so far as it is something future, it follows that when happiness is no longer future, but present, it is incompatible with the virtue of hope. Consequently hope, like faith, is voided in heaven, and neither of them can be in the blessed.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus, etsi esset comprehensor, et per consequens beatus, quantum ad divinam fruitionem; erat tamen simul viator quantum ad passibilitatem naturae, quam adhuc gerebat. Et ideo gloriam impassibilitatis et immortalitatis sperare poterat. Non tamen ita quod haberet virtutem spei, quae non respicit gloriam corporis sicut principale obiectum, sed potius fruitionem divinam.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although Christ was a comprehensor and therefore blessed as to the enjoyment of God, nevertheless He was, at the same time, a wayfarer, as regards the passibility of nature, to which He was still subject. Hence it was possible for Him to hope for the glory of impassibility and immortality, yet not so as to the virtue of hope, the principal object of which is not the glory of the body but the enjoyment of God.




Ad secundum dicendum quod beatitudo sanctorum dicitur vita aeterna, quia per hoc quod Deo fruuntur, efficiuntur quodammodo participes aeternitatis divinae, quae excedit omne tempus. Et ita continuatio beatitudinis non diversificatur per praesens, praeteritum et futurum. Et ideo beati non habent spem de continuatione beatitudinis, sed habent ipsam rem, quia non est ibi ratio futuri.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The happiness of the saints is called eternal life, because through enjoying God they become partakers, as it were, of God's eternity which surpasses all time: so that the continuation of happiness does not differ in respect of present, past and future. Hence the blessed do not hope for the continuation of their happiness (for as regards this there is no future), but are in actual possession thereof.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, durante virtute spei, eadem spe aliquis sperat beatitudinem sibi et aliis. Sed evacuata spe in beatis qua sperabant sibi beatitudinem, sperant quidem aliis beatitudinem, sed non virtute spei, sed magis ex amore caritatis. Sicut etiam qui habet caritatem Dei eadem caritate diligit proximum, et tamen aliquis potest diligere proximum non habens virtutem caritatis, alio quodam amore.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 So long as the virtue of hope lasts, it is by the same hope that one hopes for one's own happiness, and for that of others. But when hope is voided in the blessed, whereby they hoped for their own happiness, they hope for the happiness of others indeed, yet not by the virtue of hope, but rather by the love of charity. Even so, he that has Divine charity, by that same charity loves his neighbor, without having the virtue of charity, but by some other love.




Ad quartum dicendum quod, cum spes sit virtus theologica habens Deum pro obiecto, principale obiectum spei est gloria animae, quae in fruitione divina consistit, non autem gloria corporis. Gloria etiam corporis, etsi habeat rationem ardui per comparationem ad naturam humanam, non habet tamen rationem ardui habenti gloriam animae. Tum quia gloria corporis est minimum quiddam in comparatione ad gloriam animae. Tum etiam quia habens gloriam animae habet iam sufficienter causam gloriae corporis.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Since hope is a theological virtue having God for its object, its principal object is the glory of the soul, which consists in the enjoyment of God, and not the glory of the body. Moreover, although the glory of the body is something arduous in comparison with human nature, yet it is not so for one who has the glory of the soul; both because the glory of the body is a very small thing as compared with the glory of the soul, and because one who has the glory of the soul has already the sufficient cause of the glory of the body.

Quia ergo bonum arduum possibile non cadit sub ratione spei nisi secundum quod est futurum, ideo, cum beatitudo iam non fuerit futura sed praesens, non potest ibi esse virtus spei. Et ideo spes, sicut et fides, evacuatur in patria, et neutrum eorum in beatis esse potest.

Non tamen ita quod haberet virtutem spei, quae non respicit gloriam corporis sicut principale obiectum, sed potius fruitionem divinam.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut Gregorius dicit, XXXIII Moral., hoc dicitur de Diabolo secundum membra eius, quorum spes annullabitur. Vel si intelligatur de ipso Diabolo, potest referri ad spem qua sperat se de sanctis victoriam obtinere, secundum illud quod supra praemiserat, habet fiduciam quod Iordanis influat in os eius. Haec autem non est spes de qua loquimur.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 As Gregory says (Moral. xxxiii, 20) this is said of the devil as regards his members, whose hope will fail utterly: or, if it be understood of the devil himself, it may refer to the hope whereby he expects to vanquish the saints, in which sense we read just before (
Job 40:18
): "He trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth": this is not, however, the hope of which we are speaking.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus dicit, in Enchirid., fides est et malarum rerum et bonarum, et praeteritarum et praesentium et futurarum, et suarum et alienarum, sed spes non est nisi rerum bonarum futurarum ad se pertinentium. Et ideo magis potest esse fides informis in damnatis quam spes, quia bona divina non sunt eis futura possibilia, sed sunt eis absentia.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 As Augustine says (Enchiridion viii), "faith is about things, bad or good, past, present, or future, one's own or another's; whereas hope is only about good things, future and concerning oneself." Hence it is possible for lifeless faith to be in the damned, but not hope, since the Divine goods are not for them future possible things, but far removed from them.




Ad tertium dicendum quod defectus spei in damnatis non variat demeritum, sicut nec evacuatio spei in beatis auget meritum, sed utrumque contingit propter mutationem status.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Lack of hope in the damned does not change their demerit, as neither does the voiding of hope in the blessed increase their merit: but both these things are due to the change in their respective states.
