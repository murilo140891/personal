 Its daughters.

Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit ex parte peccatorum quae ex gula oriuntur. Non autem oportet quod causa sit potior, nisi in causis per se. Gula autem non est causa illorum vitiorum per se, sed quasi per accidens et per occasionem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This objection argues from the standpoint of the sins that result from gluttony. Nor is a cause necessarily more powerful, unless it be a direct cause: and gluttony is not the direct cause but the accidental cause, as it were, and the occasion of other vices.




Ad tertium dicendum quod gulosus non intendit suo corpori nocumentum inferre, sed in cibo delectari, si autem nocumentum corporis sequatur, hoc est per accidens. Unde hoc non directe pertinet ad gravitatem gulae. Cuius tamen culpa aggravatur si quis corporale detrimentum incurrat propter immoderatam cibi sumptionem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The glutton intends, not the harm to his body, but the pleasure of eating: and if injury results to his body, this is accidental. Hence this does not directly affect the gravity of gluttony, the guilt of which is nevertheless aggravated, if a man incur some bodily injury through taking too much food.

Ad tertium dicendum quod in quibuscumque aliis vitiis diversae circumstantiae habent diversa motiva, oportet accipi diversas species vitiorum secundum diversas circumstantias. Sed hoc non contingit in omnibus, ut dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 In all other vices, whenever different circumstances correspond to different motives, the difference of circumstances argues a specific difference of vice: but this does not apply to all circumstances, as stated above (

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ipse cibus ordinatur quidem ad aliquid sicut ad finem, sed quia ille finis, scilicet conservatio vitae, est maxime appetibilis, quae sine cibo conservari non potest, inde etiam est quod ipse cibus est maxime appetibilis; et ad hoc fere totus labor humanae vitae ordinatur, secundum illud Eccle. VI, omnis labor hominis in ore eius. Et tamen gula magis videtur esse circa delectationes cibi quam circa cibos. Propter quod, ut Augustinus dicit, in libro de vera Relig., quibus vilis est corporis salus, malunt vesci, in quo scilicet est delectatio, quam saturari, cum omnis finis illius voluptatis sit non sitire atque esurire.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 It is true that food itself is directed to something as its end: but since that end, namely the sustaining of life, is most desirable and whereas life cannot be sustained without food, it follows that food too is most desirable: indeed, nearly all the toil of man's life is directed thereto, according to Eccles. 6:7, "All the labor of man is for his mouth." Yet gluttony seems to be about pleasures of food rather than about food itself; wherefore, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig. liii), "with such food as is good for the worthless body, men desire to be fed," wherein namely the pleasure consists, "rather than to be filled: since the whole end of that desire is this—not to thirst and not to hunger."




Ad secundum dicendum quod finis in peccato accipitur ex parte conversionis, sed gravitas peccati accipitur ex parte aversionis. Et ideo non oportet vitium capitale, quod habet finem maxime appetibilem, habere magnam gravitatem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 In sin the end is ascertained with respect to the conversion, while the gravity of sin is determined with regard to the aversion. Wherefore it does not follow that the capital sin which has the most desirable end surpasses the others in gravity.




Ad tertium dicendum quod delectabile est appetibile secundum se. Et ideo secundum eius diversitatem ponuntur duo vitia capitalia, scilicet gula et luxuria. Utile autem non habet ex se rationem appetibilis, sed secundum quod ad aliud ordinatur. Et ideo in omnibus utilibus videtur esse una ratio appetibilitatis. Et propter hoc circa huiusmodi non ponitur nisi unum vitium capitale.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 That which gives pleasure is desirable in itself: and consequently corresponding to its diversity there are two capital vices, namely gluttony and lust. On the other hand, that which is useful is desirable, not in itself, but as directed to something else: wherefore seemingly in all useful things there is one aspect of desirability. Hence there is but one capital vice, in respect of such things.
