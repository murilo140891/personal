Octavo, de filiabus eius.
        


(8)
 Of its daughters.

Ad quintum dicendum quod sicut liberalitas est circa mediocres pecunias, ita et illiberalitas. Unde tyranni, qui magna per violentiam auferunt, non dicuntur illiberales, sed iniusti.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 Just as liberality is about moderate sums of money, so is illiberality. Wherefore tyrants who take great things by violence, are said to be, not illiberal, but unjust.
