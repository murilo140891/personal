# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, simpliciter loquendo, non possumus omnibus benefacere in speciali, nullus tamen est de quo non possit occurrere casus in quo oporteat ei benefacere etiam in speciali. Et ideo caritas requirit ut homo, etsi non actu alicui benefaciat, habeat tamen hoc in sui animi praeparatione, ut benefaciat cuicumque si tempus adesset. Aliquod tamen beneficium est quod possumus omnibus impendere, si non in speciali saltem in generali, sicut cum oramus pro omnibus fidelibus et infidelibus.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Absolutely speaking it is impossible to do good to every single one: yet it is true of each individual that one may be bound to do good to him in some particular case. Hence charity binds us, though not actually doing good to someone, to be prepared in mind to do good to anyone if we have time to spare. There is however a good that we can do to all, if not to each individual, at least to all in general, as when we pray for all, for unbelievers as well as for the faithful.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in peccatore duo sunt, scilicet culpa et natura. Est ergo subveniendum peccatori quantum ad sustentationem naturae, non est autem ei subveniendum ad fomentum culpae; hoc enim non esset benefacere, sed potius malefacere.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 In a sinner there are two things, his guilt and his nature. Accordingly we are bound to succor the sinner as to the maintenance of his nature, but not so as to abet his sin, for this would be to do evil rather than good.




Ad tertium dicendum quod excommunicatis et reipublicae hostibus sunt beneficia subtrahenda inquantum per hoc arcentur a culpa. Si tamen immineret necessitas, ne natura deficeret, esset eis subveniendum, debito tamen modo, puta ne fame aut siti morerentur, aut aliquod huiusmodi dispendium, nisi secundum ordinem iustitiae, paterentur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The excommunicated and the enemies of the common weal are deprived of all beneficence, in so far as this prevents them from doing evil deeds. Yet if their nature be in urgent need of succor lest it fail, we are bound to help them: for instance, if they be in danger of death through hunger or thirst, or suffer some like distress, unless this be according to the order of justice.

Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod beneficentia sit specialis virtus. Praecepta enim ad virtutes ordinantur, quia legislatores intendunt facere homines virtuosos, sicut dicitur in II Ethic. Sed seorsum datur praeceptum de beneficentia et de dilectione, dicitur enim Matth. V, diligite inimicos vestros, benefacite his qui oderunt vos. Ergo beneficentia est virtus distincta a caritate.
        


Objection 1:
 It would seem that beneficence is a special virtue. For precepts are directed to virtue, since lawgivers purpose to make men virtuous (Ethic. i 9,13; ii, 1). Now beneficence and love are prescribed as distinct from one another, for it is written (
Mt. 4:44
): "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you." Therefore beneficence is a virtue distinct from charity.




Praeterea, vitia virtutibus opponuntur. Sed beneficentiae opponuntur aliqua specialia vitia, per quae nocumentum proximo infertur, puta rapina, furtum et alia huiusmodi. Ergo beneficentia est specialis virtus.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, vices are opposed to virtues. Now there are opposed to beneficence certain vices whereby a hurt is inflicted on our neighbor, for instance, rapine, theft and so forth. Therefore beneficence is a special virtue.




Praeterea, caritas non distinguitur in multas species. Sed beneficentia videtur distingui in multas species, secundum diversas beneficiorum species. Ergo beneficentia est alia virtus a caritate
        
Objection 3:
 Further, charity is not divided into several species: whereas there would seem to be several kinds of beneficence, according to the various kinds of benefits. Therefore beneficence is a distinct virtue from charity.




Sed contra est quod actus interior et exterior non requirunt diversas virtutes. Sed beneficentia et benevolentia non differunt nisi sicut actus exterior et interior, quia beneficentia est executio benevolentiae. Ergo, sicut benevolentia non est alia virtus a caritate, ita nec beneficentia.
        
On the contrary,
 The internal and the external act do not require different virtues. Now beneficence and goodwill differ only as external and internal act, since beneficence is the execution of goodwill. Therefore as goodwill is not a distinct virtue from charity, so neither is beneficence.




Respondeo dicendum quod virtutes diversificantur secundum diversas rationes obiecti. Eadem autem est ratio formalis obiecti caritatis et beneficentiae, nam utraque respicit communem rationem boni, ut ex praedictis patet. Unde beneficentia non est alia virtus a caritate, sed nominat quendam caritatis actum.
        


I answer that,
 Virtues differ according to the different aspects of their objects. Now the formal aspect of the object of charity and of beneficence is the same, since both virtues regard the common aspect of good, as explained above (
Article [1]
). Wherefore beneficence is not a distinct virtue from charity, but denotes an act of charity.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod praecepta non dantur de habitibus virtutum, sed de actibus. Et ideo diversitas praeceptorum non significat diversos habitus virtutum, sed diversos actus.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Precepts are given, not about habits but about acts of virtue: wherefore distinction of precept denotes distinction, not of habits, but of acts.




Ad secundum dicendum quod sicut omnia beneficia proximo exhibita, inquantum considerantur sub communi ratione boni, reducuntur ad amorem; ita omnia nocumenta, inquantum considerantur secundum communem rationem mali, reducuntur ad odium. Prout autem considerantur secundum aliquas speciales rationes vel boni vel mali, reducuntur ad aliquas speciales virtutes vel vitia. Et secundum hoc etiam sunt diversae beneficiorum species.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Even as all benefits conferred on our neighbor, if we consider them under the common aspect of good, are to be traced to love, so all hurts considered under the common aspect of evil, are to be traced to hatred. But if we consider these same things under certain special aspects of good or of evil, they are to be traced to certain special virtues or vices, and in this way also there are various kinds of benefits.




Unde patet responsio ad tertium.
        
Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident.

Praeterea, vitia virtutibus opponuntur. Sed beneficentiae opponuntur aliqua specialia vitia, per quae nocumentum proximo infertur, puta rapina, furtum et alia huiusmodi. Ergo beneficentia est specialis virtus.
