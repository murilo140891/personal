# Summa Theologica

Quarto, de causa huius peccati. Utrum autem cum idololatris sit communicandum, dictum est supra, cum de infidelitate ageretur.
        


(4)
 Of the cause of this sin.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod sicut religio non est fides, sed fidei protestatio per aliqua exteriora signa, ita superstitio est quaedam infidelitatis protestatio per exteriorem cultum. Quam quidem protestationem nomen idololatriae significat, non autem nomen haeresis, sed solum falsam opinionem. Et ideo haeresis est species infidelitatis, sed idololatria est species superstitionis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Just as religion is not faith, but a confession of faith by outward signs, so superstition is a confession of unbelief by external worship. Such a confession is signified by the term idolatry, but not by the term heresy, which only means a false opinion. Therefore heresy is a species of unbelief, but idolatry is a species of superstition.




Ad secundum dicendum quod nomen latriae dupliciter accipi potest. Uno modo potest significare humanum actum ad cultum Dei pertinentem. Et secundum hoc, non variatur significatio huius nominis latria, cuicumque exhibeatur, quia illud cui exhibetur non cadet, secundum hoc, in eius definitione. Et secundum hoc latria univoce dicetur secundum quod pertinet ad veram religionem, et secundum quod pertinet ad idololatriam, sicut solutio tributi univoce dicitur sive exhibeatur vero regi, sive falso. Alio modo accipitur latria prout est idem religioni. Et sic, cum sit virtus, de ratione eius est quod cultus divinus exhibeatur ei cui debet exhiberi. Et secundum hoc latria aequivoce dicetur de latria verae religionis, et de idololatria, sicut prudentia aequivoce dicitur de prudentia quae est virtus, et de prudentia quae est carnis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The term latria may be taken in two senses. In one sense it may denote a human act pertaining to the worship of God: and then its signification remains the same, to whomsoever it be shown, because, in this sense, the thing to which it is shown is not included in its definition. Taken thus latria is applied univocally, whether to true religion or to idolatry, just as the payment of a tax is univocally the same, whether it is paid to the true or to a false king. In another sense latria denotes the same as religion, and then, since it is a virtue, it is essential thereto that divine worship be given to whom it ought to be given; and in this way latria is applied equivocally to the latria of true religion, and to idolatry: just as prudence is applied equivocally to the prudence that is a virtue, and to that which is carnal.




Ad tertium dicendum quod apostolus intelligit nihil esse in mundo quia imagines illae quae idola dicebantur, non erant animatae aut aliquam virtutem divinitatis habentes, sicut Hermes ponebat, quasi esset aliquid compositum ex spiritu et corpore. Et similiter intelligendum est quod idolis immolatum non est aliquid, quia per huiusmodi immolationem carnes immolatitiae neque aliquam sanctificationem consequebantur, ut gentiles putabant; neque aliquam immunditiam, ut putabant Iudaei.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The saying of the Apostle that "an idol is nothing in the world" means that those images which were called idols, were not animated, or possessed of a divine power, as Hermes maintained, as though they were composed of spirit and body. In the same sense we must understand the saying that "what is offered in sacrifice to idols is not anything," because by being thus sacrificed the sacrificial flesh acquired neither sanctification, as the Gentiles thought, nor uncleanness, as the Jews held.




Ad quartum dicendum quod ex communi consuetudine qua creaturas quascumque colebant gentiles sub quibusdam imaginibus, impositum est hoc nomen idololatria ad significandum quemcumque cultum creaturae, et etiam si sine imaginibus fieret.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 It was owing to the general custom among the Gentiles of worshipping any kind of creature under the form of images that the term "idolatry" was used to signify any worship of a creature, even without the use of images.

Ad quartum dicendum quod haeresis Manichaeorum, etiam quantum ad genus peccati, gravior est quam peccatum aliorum idololatrarum, quia magis derogant divino honori, ponentes duos deos contrarios, et multa vana fabulosa de Deo fingentes. Secus autem est de aliis haereticis, qui unum Deum confitentur et eum solum colunt
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Even as to the genus of the sin, the Manichean heresy is more grievous than the sin of other idolaters, because it is more derogatory to the divine honor, since they set up two gods in opposition to one another, and hold many vain and fabulous fancies about God. It is different with other heretics, who confess their belief in one God and worship Him alone.




Ad quintum dicendum quod observatio legis tempore gratiae non est omnino aequalis idololatriae secundum genus peccati, sed paene aequalis, quia utrumque est species pestiferae superstitionis.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 The observance of the Law during the time of grace is not quite equal to idolatry as to the genus of the sin, but almost equal, because both are species of pestiferous superstition.

Ad secundum dicendum quod in prima aetate non fuit idololatria propter recentem memoriam creationis mundi, ex qua adhuc vigebat cognitio unius Dei in mente hominum. In sexta autem aetate idololatria est exclusa per doctrinam et virtutem Christi, qui de Diabolo triumphavit.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 There was no idolatry in the first age, owing to the recent remembrance of the creation of the world, so that man still retained in his mind the knowledge of one God. In the sixth age idolatry was banished by the doctrine and power of Christ, who triumphed over the devil.




Ad tertium dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de causa consummativa idololatriae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This argument considers the consummative cause of idolatry.
