# Summa Theologica

Cum ergo aliquis cognoscit se moveri a spiritu sancto ad aliquid aestimandum, vel significandum verbo vel facto, hoc proprie ad prophetiam pertinet. Cum autem movetur, sed non cognoscit, non est perfecta prophetia, sed quidam instinctus propheticus. Sciendum tamen quod, quia mens prophetae est instrumentum deficiens, sicut dictum est et veri prophetae non omnia cognoscunt quae in eorum visis aut verbis aut etiam factis spiritus sanctus intendit.
        
Accordingly, when a man knows that he is being moved by the Holy Ghost to think something, or signify something by word or deed, this belongs properly to prophecy; whereas when he is moved, without his knowing it, this is not perfect prophecy, but a prophetic instinct. Nevertheless it must be observed that since the prophet's mind is a defective instrument, as stated above, even true prophets know not all that the Holy Ghost means by the things they see, or speak, or even do.




Et per hoc patet responsio ad obiecta. Nam primae rationes loquuntur de veris prophetis, quorum mens divinitus illustratur perfecte.
        
And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections, since the arguments given at the beginning refer to true prophets whose minds are perfectly enlightened from above.
