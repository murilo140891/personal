# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod, secundum philosophum, in II Rhet., iratus intendit manifestam offensam, quod non curat odiens. Et ideo contumelia, quae importat manifestam iniuriam, magis pertinet ad iram quam ad odium.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 According to the Philosopher (Rhet. ii, 4) "an angry man seeks an open offense, but he who hates does not worry about this." Hence reviling which denotes a manifest injury belongs to anger rather than to hatred.
