# Summa Theologica

Ad sextum dicendum quod sicut in dilectione Dei includitur dilectio proximi, ut supra dictum est; ita etiam in hoc quod homo servit Deo includitur quod unicuique reddat quod debet.
        


Reply to Objection 6:
 Just as love of God includes love of our neighbor, as stated above (
Question [25]
, 
Article [1]
), so too the service of God includes rendering to each one his due.

Ad tertium dicendum quod iustitia non consistit circa exteriores res quantum ad facere, quod pertinet ad artem, sed quantum ad hoc quod utitur eis ad alterum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Justice is concerned about external things, not by making them, which pertains to art, but by using them in our dealings with other men.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod quia voluntas est appetitus rationalis, ideo rectitudo rationis, quae veritas dicitur, voluntati impressa, propter propinquitatem ad rationem, nomen retinet veritatis. Et inde est quod quandoque iustitia veritas vocatur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Since the will is the rational appetite, when the rectitude of the reason which is called truth is imprinted on the will on account of its nighness to the reason, this imprint retains the name of truth; and hence it is that justice sometimes goes by the name of truth.




Ad secundum dicendum quod voluntas fertur in suum obiectum consequenter ad apprehensionem rationis. Et ideo, quia ratio ordinat in alterum, voluntas potest velle aliquid in ordine ad alterum, quod pertinet ad iustitiam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The will is borne towards its object consequently on the apprehension of reason: wherefore, since the reason directs one thing in relation to another, the will can will one thing in relation to another, and this belongs to justice.




Ad tertium dicendum quod rationale per participationem non solum est irascibilis et concupiscibilis, sed omnino appetitivum, ut dicitur in I Ethic., quia omnis appetitus obedit rationi. Sub appetitivo autem comprehenditur voluntas. Et ideo voluntas potest esse subiectum virtutis moralis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Not only the irascible and concupiscible parts are "rational by participation," but the entire "appetitive" faculty, as stated in Ethic. i, 13, because all appetite is subject to reason. Now the will is contained in the appetitive faculty, wherefore it can be the subject of moral virtue.

Ad secundum dicendum quod voluntas fertur in suum obiectum consequenter ad apprehensionem rationis. Et ideo, quia ratio ordinat in alterum, voluntas potest velle aliquid in ordine ad alterum, quod pertinet ad iustitiam.

Potest tamen quaelibet virtus, secundum quod a praedicta virtute, speciali quidem in essentia, generali autem secundum virtutem, ordinatur ad bonum commune, dici iustitia legalis. Et hoc modo loquendi iustitia legalis est idem in essentia cum omni virtute, differt autem ratione. Et hoc modo loquitur philosophus.
        
However the name of legal justice can be given to every virtue, in so far as every virtue is directed to the common good by the aforesaid legal justice, which though special essentially is nevertheless virtually general. Speaking in this way, legal justice is essentially the same as all virtue, but differs therefrom logically: and it is in this sense that the Philosopher speaks.




Unde patet responsio ad primum et secundum.
        
Wherefore the Replies to the First and Second Objections are manifest.
      


Ad tertium dicendum quod etiam illa ratio secundum hunc modum procedit de iustitia legali, secundum quod virtus imperata a iustitia legali iustitia legalis dicitur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This argument again takes legal justice for the virtue commanded by legal justice.




Ad quartum dicendum quod quaelibet virtus secundum propriam rationem ordinat actum suum ad proprium finem illius virtutis. Quod autem ordinetur ad ulteriorem finem, sive semper sive aliquando, hoc non habet ex propria ratione, sed oportet esse aliam superiorem virtutem a qua in illum finem ordinetur. Et sic oportet esse unam virtutem superiorem quae ordinet omnes virtutes in bonum commune, quae est iustitia legalis, et est alia per essentiam ab omni virtute.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Every virtue strictly speaking directs its act to that virtue's proper end: that it should happen to be directed to a further end either always or sometimes, does not belong to that virtue considered strictly, for it needs some higher virtue to direct it to that end. Consequently there must be one supreme virtue essentially distinct from every other virtue, which directs all the virtues to the common good; and this virtue is legal justice.

Unde patet responsio ad primum et secundum.

Ad secundum dicendum quod bonum commune civitatis et bonum singulare unius personae non differunt solum secundum multum et paucum, sed secundum formalem differentiam, alia enim est ratio boni communis et boni singularis, sicut et alia est ratio totius et partis. Et ideo philosophus, in I Polit., dicit quod non bene dicunt qui dicunt civitatem et domum et alia huiusmodi differre solum multitudine et paucitate, et non specie.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The common good of the realm and the particular good of the individual differ not only in respect of the "many" and the "few," but also under a formal aspect. For the aspect of the "common" good differs from the aspect of the "individual" good, even as the aspect of "whole" differs from that of "part." Wherefore the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 1) that "they are wrong who maintain that the State and the home and the like differ only as many and few and not specifically."




Ad tertium dicendum quod domestica multitudo, secundum philosophum, in I Polit., distinguitur secundum tres coniugationes, scilicet uxoris et viri, patris et filii, domini et servi, quarum personarum una est quasi aliquid alterius. Et ideo ad huiusmodi personam non est simpliciter iustitia, sed quaedam iustitiae species, scilicet oeconomica, ut dicitur in V Ethic.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The household community, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 2), differs in respect of a threefold fellowship; namely "of husband and wife, father and son, master and slave," in each of which one person is, as it were, part of the other. Wherefore between such persons there is not justice simply, but a species of justice, viz. "domestic" justice, as stated in Ethic. v, 6.

Sed materia iustitiae est exterior operatio secundum quod ipsa, vel res cuius est usus, debitam proportionem habet ad aliam personam. Et ideo medium iustitiae consistit in quadam proportionis aequalitate rei exterioris ad personam exteriorem. Aequale autem est realiter medium inter maius et minus, ut dicitur in X Metaphys. Unde iustitia habet medium rei.
        
On the other hand, the matter of justice is external operation, in so far as an operation or the thing used in that operation is duly proportionate to another person, wherefore the mean of justice consists in a certain proportion of equality between the external thing and the external person. Now equality is the real mean between greater and less, as stated in Metaph. x [*Didot ed., ix, 5; Cf. Ethic. v, 4]: wherefore justice observes the real mean.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod hoc medium rei est etiam medium rationis. Et ideo in iustitia salvatur ratio virtutis moralis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This real mean is also the rational mean, wherefore justice satisfies the conditions of a moral virtue.




Ad secundum dicendum quod bonum simpliciter dupliciter dicitur. Uno modo, quod est omnibus modis bonum, sicut virtutes sunt bonae. Et sic in his quae sunt bona simpliciter non est accipere medium et extrema. Alio modo dicitur aliquid simpliciter bonum quia est absolute bonum, scilicet secundum suam naturam consideratum, quamvis per abusum possit fieri malum, sicut patet de divitiis et honoribus. Et in talibus potest accipi superfluum, diminutum et medium quantum ad homines, qui possunt eis uti vel bene vel male. Ei sic circa simpliciter bona dicitur esse iustitia.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 We may speak of a thing being good simply in two ways. First a thing may be good in every way: thus the virtues are good; and there is neither mean nor extremes in things that are good simply in this sense. Secondly a thing is said to be good simply through being good absolutely i.e. in its nature, although it may become evil through being abused. Such are riches and honors; and in the like it is possible to find excess, deficiency and mean, as regards men who can use them well or ill: and it is in this sense that justice is about things that are good simply.




Ad tertium dicendum quod iniuria illata aliam proportionem habet ad principem, et aliam ad personam privatam. Et ideo oportet aliter adaequare utramque iniuriam per vindictam. Quod pertinet ad diversitatem rei, et non solum ad diversitatem rationis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The injury inflicted bears a different proportion to a prince from that which it bears to a private person: wherefore each injury requires to be equalized by vengeance in a different way: and this implies a real and not merely a rational diversity.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod hoc medium rei est etiam medium rationis. Et ideo in iustitia salvatur ratio virtutis moralis.

Sed contra est quod Tullius dicit, in I de Offic., in iustitia virtutis splendor est maximus, ex qua boni viri nominantur.
        
On the contrary,
 Tully says (De Offic. i, 7): "Justice is the most resplendent of the virtues, and gives its name to a good man."




Respondeo dicendum quod si loquamur de iustitia legali, manifestum est quod ipsa est praeclarior inter omnes virtutes morales, inquantum bonum commune praeeminet bono singulari unius personae. Et secundum hoc philosophus, in V Ethic., dicit quod praeclarissima virtutum videtur esse iustitia, et neque est Hesperus neque Lucifer ita admirabilis. Sed etiam si loquamur de iustitia particulari, praecellit inter alias virtutes morales, duplici ratione. Quarum prima potest sumi ex parte subiecti, quia scilicet est in nobiliori parte animae, idest in appetitu rationali, scilicet voluntate; aliis virtutibus moralibus existentibus in appetitu sensitivo, ad quem pertinent passiones, quae sunt materia aliarum virtutum moralium. Secunda ratio sumitur ex parte obiecti. Nam aliae virtutes laudantur solum secundum bonum ipsius virtuosi. Iustitia autem laudatur secundum quod virtuosus ad alium bene se habet, et sic iustitia quodammodo est bonum alterius, ut dicitur in V Ethic. Et propter hoc philosophus dicit, in I Rhet., necesse est maximas esse virtutes eas quae sunt aliis honestissimae, siquidem est virtus potentia benefactiva. Propter hoc fortes et iustos maxime honorant, quoniam fortitudo est utilis aliis in bello, iustitia autem et in bello et in pace.
        
I answer that,
 If we speak of legal justice, it is evident that it stands foremost among all the moral virtues, for as much as the common good transcends the individual good of one person. In this sense the Philosopher declares (Ethic. v, 1) that "the most excellent of the virtues would seem to be justice, and more glorious than either the evening or the morning star." But, even if we speak of particular justice, it excels the other moral virtues for two reasons. The first reason may be taken from the subject, because justice is in the more excellent part of the soul, viz. the rational appetite or will, whereas the other moral virtues are in the sensitive appetite, whereunto appertain the passions which are the matter of the other moral virtues. The second reason is taken from the object, because the other virtues are commendable in respect of the sole good of the virtuous person himself, whereas justice is praiseworthy in respect of the virtuous person being well disposed towards another, so that justice is somewhat the good of another person, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Hence the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 9): "The greatest virtues must needs be those which are most profitable to other persons, because virtue is a faculty of doing good to others. For this reason the greatest honors are accorded the brave and the just, since bravery is useful to others in warfare, and justice is useful to others both in warfare and in time of peace."




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod liberalitas, etsi de suo det, tamen hoc facit inquantum in hoc considerat propriae virtutis bonum. Iustitia autem dat alteri quod suum est quasi considerans bonum commune. Et Praeterea iustitia observatur ad omnes, liberalitas autem ad omnes se extendere non potest. Et iterum liberalitas, quae de suo dat, supra iustitiam fundatur, per quam conservatur unicuique quod suum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although the liberal man gives of his own, yet he does so in so far as he takes into consideration the good of his own virtue, while the just man gives to another what is his, through consideration of the common good. Moreover justice is observed towards all, whereas liberality cannot extend to all. Again liberality which gives of a man's own is based on justice, whereby one renders to each man what is his.




Ad secundum dicendum quod magnanimitas, inquantum supervenit iustitiae, auget eius bonitatem. Quae tamen sine iustitia nec virtutis rationem haberet.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 When magnanimity is added to justice it increases the latter's goodness; and yet without justice it would not even be a virtue.




Ad tertium dicendum quod fortitudo consistit circa difficiliora, non tamen est circa meliora, cum sit solum in bello utilis, iustitia autem et in pace et in bello, sicut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although fortitude is about the most difficult things, it is not about the best, for it is only useful in warfare, whereas justice is useful both in war and in peace, as stated above.
