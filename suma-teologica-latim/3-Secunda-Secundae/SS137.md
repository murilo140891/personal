# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod constantia pertinet quidem ad perseverantiam, inquantum convenit cum ea, non tamen est idem ei inquantum differt ab ea ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Constancy pertains to perseverance in so far as it has something in common with it: but it is not the same thing in the point of their difference, as stated in the Article.
