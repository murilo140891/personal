# Summa Theologica

Ad quartum dicendum quod lumen propheticum se extendit etiam ad directiones humanorum actuum. Et secundum hoc, prophetia necessaria est ad populi gubernationem. Et praecipue in ordine ad cultum divinum, ad quem natura non sufficit, sed requiritur gratia.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 The prophetic light extends even to the direction of human acts; and in this way prophecy is requisite for the government of a people, especially in relation to Divine worship; since for this nature is not sufficient, and grace is necessary.

Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut apostolus dicit, Rom. XIII, quae a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt. Habet autem hoc divinitatis ordo, sicut Dionysius dicit, ut infima per media disponat. Angeli autem medii sunt inter Deum et homines, utpote plus participantes de perfectione divinae bonitatis quam homines. Et ideo illuminationes et revelationes divinae a Deo ad homines per Angelos deferuntur. Prophetica autem cognitio fit secundum illuminationem et revelationem divinam. Unde manifestum est quod fiat per Angelos.
        


I answer that,
 As the Apostle says (
Rm. 13:1
), "Things that are of God are well ordered [*Vulg.: 'Those that are, are ordained of God.']." Now the Divine ordering, according to Dionysius [*Coel. Hier. iv; Eccl. Hier. v], is such that the lowest things are directed by middle things. Now the angels hold a middle position between God and men, in that they have a greater share in the perfection of the Divine goodness than men have. Wherefore the Divine enlightenments and revelations are conveyed from God to men by the angels. Now prophetic knowledge is bestowed by Divine enlightenment and revelation. Therefore it is evident that it is conveyed by the angels.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod caritas, secundum quam fit homo amicus Dei, est perfectio voluntatis, in quam solus Deus imprimere potest. Sed prophetia est perfectio intellectus, in quem etiam Angelus potest imprimere, ut in primo dictum est. Et ideo non est similis ratio de utroque.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Charity which makes man a friend of God, is a perfection of the will, in which God alone can form an impression; whereas prophecy is a perfection of the intellect, in which an angel also can form an impression, as stated in the FP, Question [111], Article [1], wherefore the comparison fails between the two.




Ad secundum dicendum quod gratiae gratis datae attribuuntur spiritui sancto sicut primo principio, qui tamen operatur huiusmodi gratias in hominibus mediante ministerio Angelorum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The gratuitous graces are ascribed to the Holy Ghost as their first principle: yet He works grace of this kind in men by means of the angels.




Ad tertium dicendum quod operatio instrumenti attribuitur principali agenti, in cuius virtute instrumentum agit. Et quia minister est sicut instrumentum, idcirco prophetica revelatio, quae fit ministerio Angelorum, dicitur esse divina.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The work of the instrument is ascribed to the principal agent by whose power the instrument acts. And since a minister is like an instrument, prophetic revelation, which is conveyed by the ministry of the angels, is said to be Divine.
