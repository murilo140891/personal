# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod cultus et officium, ut Tullius dicit, debetur omnibus sanguine iunctis et patriae benevolis, non tamen aequaliter omnibus, sed praecipue parentibus, aliis autem secundum propriam facultatem et decentiam personarum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), "we offer homage and duty to all our kindred and to the well-wishers of our country"; not, however, equally to all, but chiefly to our parents, and to others according to our means and their personal claims.

Ad tertium sic proceditur. Videtur quod pietas non sit specialis virtus ab aliis distincta. Exhibere enim obsequium et cultum aliquibus ex amore procedit. Sed hoc pertinet ad pietatem. Ergo pietas non est virtus a caritate distincta.
        
Objection 1:
 It seems that piety is not a special virtue distinct from other virtues. For the giving of service and homage to anyone proceeds from love. But it belongs to piety. Therefore piety is not a distinct virtue from charity.




Praeterea, cultum Deo exhibere est proprium religionis. Sed etiam pietas exhibet Deo cultum, ut Augustinus dicit, X de Civ. Dei. Ergo pietas non distinguitur a religione.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, it is proper to religion to give worship to God. But piety also gives worship to God, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x). Therefore piety is not distinct from religion.




Praeterea, pietas quae exhibet cultum et officium patriae videtur idem esse cum iustitia legali, quae respicit bonum commune. Sed iustitia legalis est virtus generalis, ut patet per philosophum, in V Ethic. Ergo pietas non est virtus specialis.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, piety, whereby we give our country worship and duty, seems to be the same as legal justice, which looks to the common good. But legal justice is a general virtue, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 1,2). Therefore piety is not a special virtue.




Sed contra est quod ponitur a Tullio pars iustitiae.
        
On the contrary,
 It is accounted by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) as a part of justice.




Respondeo dicendum quod virtus aliqua est specialis ex hoc quod respicit aliquod obiectum secundum aliquam rationem specialem. Cum autem ad rationem iustitiae pertineat quod debitum alii reddat, ubi invenitur specialis ratio debiti alicui personae, ibi est specialis virtus. Debetur autem aliquid specialiter alicui quia est connaturale principium producens in esse et gubernans. Hoc autem principium respicit pietas, inquantum parentibus et patriae, et his qui ad haec ordinantur, officium et cultum impendit. Et ideo pietas est specialis virtus.
        
I answer that,
 A special virtue is one that regards an object under a special aspect. Since, then, the nature of justice consists in rendering another person his due, wherever there is a special aspect of something due to a person, there is a special virtue. Now a thing is indebted in a special way to that which is its connatural principle of being and government. And piety regards this principle, inasmuch as it pays duty and homage to our parents and country, and to those who are related thereto. Therefore piety is a special virtue.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod sicut religio est quaedam protestatio fidei, spei et caritatis, quibus homo primordialiter ordinatur in Deum; ita etiam pietas est quaedam protestatio caritatis quam quis habet ad parentes et ad patriam.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Just as religion is a protestation of faith, hope and charity, whereby man is primarily directed to God, so again piety is a protestation of the charity we bear towards our parents and country.




Ad secundum dicendum quod Deus longe excellentiori modo est principium essendi et gubernationis quam pater vel patria. Et ideo alia virtus est religio, quae cultum Deo exhibet, a pietate, quae exhibet cultum parentibus et patriae. Sed ea quae sunt creaturarum per quandam superexcellentiam et causalitatem transferuntur in Deum, ut Dionysius dicit, in libro de Div. Nom. Unde per excellentiam pietas cultus Dei nominatur, sicut et Deus excellenter dicitur pater noster.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 God is the principle of our being and government in a far more excellent manner than one's father or country. Hence religion, which gives worship to God, is a distinct virtue from piety, which pays homage to our parents and country. But things relating to creatures are transferred to God as the summit of excellence and causality, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): wherefore, by way of excellence, piety designates the worship of God, even as God, by way of excellence, is called "Our Father."




Ad tertium dicendum quod pietas se extendit ad patriam secundum quod est nobis quoddam essendi principium, sed iustitia legalis respicit bonum patriae secundum quod est bonum commune. Et ideo iustitia legalis magis habet quod sit virtus generalis quam pietas.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Piety extends to our country in so far as the latter is for us a principle of being: but legal justice regards the good of our country, considered as the common good: wherefore legal justice has more of the character of a general virtue than piety has.

Praeterea, cultum Deo exhibere est proprium religionis. Sed etiam pietas exhibet Deo cultum, ut Augustinus dicit, X de Civ. Dei. Ergo pietas non distinguitur a religione.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, it is proper to religion to give worship to God. But piety also gives worship to God, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x). Therefore piety is not distinct from religion.




Praeterea, pietas quae exhibet cultum et officium patriae videtur idem esse cum iustitia legali, quae respicit bonum commune. Sed iustitia legalis est virtus generalis, ut patet per philosophum, in V Ethic. Ergo pietas non est virtus specialis.

Respondeo dicendum quod virtus aliqua est specialis ex hoc quod respicit aliquod obiectum secundum aliquam rationem specialem. Cum autem ad rationem iustitiae pertineat quod debitum alii reddat, ubi invenitur specialis ratio debiti alicui personae, ibi est specialis virtus. Debetur autem aliquid specialiter alicui quia est connaturale principium producens in esse et gubernans. Hoc autem principium respicit pietas, inquantum parentibus et patriae, et his qui ad haec ordinantur, officium et cultum impendit. Et ideo pietas est specialis virtus.

Reply to Objection 3:
