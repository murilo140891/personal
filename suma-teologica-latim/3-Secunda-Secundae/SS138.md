# Summa Theologica

Primo, de mollitie.
        


(1)
 Of effeminacy;
      


Secundo, de pertinacia.
        


(2)
 Of pertinacity.

Secundo, de pertinacia.
        


(2)
 Of pertinacity.

Ad tertium dicendum quod aliae virtutes, etsi persistant contra impetus passionum, non tamen proprie laus earum est ex persistendo, sicut laus perseverantiae. Laus vero continentiae magis videtur ex vincendo delectationes. Et ideo pertinacia directe opponitur perseverantiae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the other virtues persist against the onslaught of the passions, they are not commended for persisting in the same way as perseverance is. As to continence, its claim to praise seems to lie rather in overcoming pleasures. Hence pertinacity is directly opposed to perseverance.
