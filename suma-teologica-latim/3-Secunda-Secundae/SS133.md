# Summa Theologica

Ad quartum dicendum quod Moyses et Ieremias digni erant officio ad quod divinitus eligebantur, ex divina gratia. Sed ipsi considerantes propriae infirmitatis insufficientiam, recusabant, non tamen pertinaciter, ne in superbiam laberentur.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Moses and Jeremias were worthy of the office to which they were appointed by God, but their worthiness was of Divine grace: yet they, considering the insufficiency of their own weakness, demurred; though not obstinately lest they should fall into pride.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de pusillanimitate ex parte causae quam habet in intellectu. Et tamen non proprie potest dici quod opponatur prudentiae etiam secundum causam suam, quia talis ignorantia non procedit ex insipientia, sed magis ex pigritia considerandi suam facultatem, ut dicitur in IV Ethic., vel exequendi quod suae subiacet potestati.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument considers pusillanimity as proceeding from a cause in the intellect. Yet it cannot be said properly that it is opposed to prudence, even in respect of its cause: because ignorance of this kind does not proceed from indiscretion but from laziness in considering one's own ability, according to Ethic. iv, 3, or in accomplishing what is within one's power.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de pusillanimitate ex parte effectus.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This argument considers pusillanimity from the point of view of its effect.




Ad tertium dicendum quod ratio illa procedit ex parte causae. Nec tamen timor causans pusillanimitatem semper est timor periculorum mortis. Unde etiam ex hac parte non oportet quod opponatur fortitudini. Ira autem, secundum rationem proprii motus, quo quis extollitur in vindictam, non causat pusillanimitatem, quae deiicit animum, sed magis tollit eam. Inducit autem ad pusillanimitatem ratione causarum irae, quae sunt iniuriae illatae, ex quibus deiicitur animus patientis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This argument considers the point of view of cause. Nor is the fear that causes pusillanimity always a fear of the dangers of death: wherefore it does not follow from this standpoint that pusillanimity is opposed to fortitude. As regards anger, if we consider it under the aspect of its proper movement, whereby a man is roused to take vengeance, it does not cause pusillanimity, which disheartens the soul; on the contrary, it takes it away. If, however, we consider the causes of anger, which are injuries inflicted whereby the soul of the man who suffers them is disheartened, it conduces to pusillanimity.




Ad quartum dicendum quod pusillanimitas est gravius peccatum, secundum propriam speciem, quam praesumptio, quia per ipsam recedit homo a bonis, quod est pessimum, ut dicitur in IV Ethic. Sed praesumptio dicitur esse nequissima ratione superbiae, ex qua procedit.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 According to its proper species pusillanimity is a graver sin than presumption, since thereby a man withdraws from good things, which is a very great evil according to Ethic. iv. Presumption, however, is stated to be "wicked" on account of pride whence it proceeds.
