# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod regnum inter alias politias est optimum regimen, ut dicitur in VIII Ethic. Et ideo species prudentiae magis debuit denominari a regno. Ita tamen quod sub regnativa comprehendantur omnia alia regimina recta, non autem perversa, quae virtuti opponuntur, unde non pertinent ad prudentiam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 A kingdom is the best of all governments, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10: wherefore the species of prudence should be denominated rather from a kingdom, yet so as to comprehend under regnative all other rightful forms of government, but not perverse forms which are opposed to virtue, and which, accordingly, do not pertain to prudence.




Ad tertium dicendum quod philosophus denominat regnativam a principali actu regis, qui est leges ponere. Quod etsi conveniat aliis, non convenit eis nisi secundum quod participant aliquid de regimine regis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The Philosopher names regnative prudence after the principal act of a king which is to make laws, and although this applies to the other forms of government, this is only in so far as they have a share of kingly government.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod sicut dictum est, regnativa est perfectissima species prudentiae. Et ideo prudentia subditorum, quae deficit a prudentia regnativa, retinet sibi nomen commune, ut politica dicatur, sicut in logicis convertibile quod non significat essentiam retinet sibi commune nomen proprii.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 As stated above, regnative is the most perfect species of prudence, wherefore the prudence of subjects, which falls short of regnative prudence, retains the common name of political prudence, even as in logic a convertible term which does not denote the essence of a thing retains the name of "proper."




Ad secundum dicendum quod diversa ratio obiecti diversificat habitum secundum speciem, ut ex supradictis patet. Eadem autem agenda considerantur quidem a rege secundum universaliorem rationem quam considerentur a subdito, qui obedit, uni enim regi in diversis officiis multi obediunt. Et ideo regnativa comparatur ad hanc politicam de qua loquimur sicut ars architectonica ad eam quae manu operatur.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 A different aspect of the object diversifies the species of a habit, as stated above (
Question [47]
, 
Article [5]
). Now the same actions are considered by the king, but under a more general aspect, as by his subjects who obey: since many obey one king in various departments. Hence regnative prudence is compared to this political prudence of which we are speaking, as mastercraft to handicraft.




Ad tertium dicendum quod per prudentiam communiter dictam regit homo seipsum in ordine ad proprium bonum, per politicam autem de qua loquimur, in ordine ad bonum commune.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Man directs himself by prudence commonly so called, in relation to his own good, but by political prudence, of which we speak, he directs himself in relation to the common good.

Ad tertium dicendum quod pater in domo habet quandam similitudinem regii principatus, ut dicitur in VIII Ethic., non tamen habet perfectam potestatem regiminis sicut rex. Et ideo non ponitur separatim paterna species prudentiae, sicut regnativa.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The father has in his household an authority like that of a king, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10, but he has not the full power of a king, wherefore paternal government is not reckoned a distinct species of prudence, like regnative prudence.

Ad secundum dicendum quod alia negotia quae sunt in civitate ordinantur ad aliquas particulares utilitates, sed militare negotium ordinatur ad tuitionem totius boni communis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Other matters in the state are directed to the profit of individuals, whereas the business of soldiering is directed to the service belongs to fortitude, but the direction, protection of the entire common good.




Ad tertium dicendum quod executio militiae pertinet ad fortitudinem, sed directio ad prudentiam, et praecipue secundum quod est in duce exercitus
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The execution of military service belongs to fortitude, but the direction, especially in so far as it concerns the commander-in-chief, belongs to prudence.

Ad tertium dicendum quod executio militiae pertinet ad fortitudinem, sed directio ad prudentiam, et praecipue secundum quod est in duce exercitus
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The execution of military service belongs to fortitude, but the direction, especially in so far as it concerns the commander-in-chief, belongs to prudence.
