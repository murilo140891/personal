# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod divinis personis convenit accipere per naturam, orare autem est accipientis per gratiam. Dicitur autem filius rogare, vel orare, secundum naturam assumptam, scilicet humanam, non secundum divinam. Spiritus autem sanctus dicitur postulare, quia postulantes nos facit.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Receiving belongs to the Divine Persons in respect of their nature, whereas prayer belongs to one who receives through grace. The Son is said to ask or pray in respect of His assumed, i.e. His human, nature and not in respect of His Godhead: and the Holy Ghost is said to ask, because He makes us ask.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio et intellectus in nobis non sunt diversae potentiae, ut in primo habitum est, differunt autem secundum perfectum et imperfectum. Et ideo quandoque intellectuales creaturae, quae sunt Angeli, distinguuntur a rationalibus, quandoque autem sub rationalibus comprehenduntur. Et hoc modo dicitur oratio esse proprium rationalis creaturae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 As stated in the FP, Question [79], Article [8], intellect and reason are not distinct powers in us: but they differ as the perfect from the imperfect. Hence intellectual creatures which are the angels are distinct from rational creatures, and sometimes are included under them. In this sense prayer is said to be proper to the rational creature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod pulli corvorum dicuntur Deum invocare, propter naturale desiderium quo omnia suo modo desiderant consequi bonitatem divinam. Sic etiam bruta animalia dicuntur Deo obedire, propter naturalem instinctum quo a Deo moventur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The young ravens are said to call upon God, on account of the natural desire whereby all things, each in its own way, desire to attain the Divine goodness. Thus too dumb animals are said to obey God, on account of the natural instinct whereby they are moved by God.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod vocalis oratio non profertur ad hoc quod aliquid ignotum Deo manifestetur, sed ad hoc quod mens orantis vel aliorum excitetur in Deum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Vocal prayer is employed, not in order to tell God something He does not know, but in order to lift up the mind of the person praying or of other persons to God.




Ad secundum dicendum quod verba ad aliud pertinentia distrahunt mentem, et impediunt devotionem orantis. Sed verba significantia aliquid ad devotionem pertinens excitant mentes, praecipue minus devotas.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Words about other matters distract the mind and hinder the devotion of those who pray: but words signifying some object of devotion lift up the mind, especially one that is less devout.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Chrysostomus dicit, super Matth., eo proposito dominus vetat in conventu orare ut a conventu videatur. Unde orans nihil novum facere debet quod aspiciant homines, vel clamando vel pectus percutiendo vel manus expandendo. Nec tamen, ut Augustinus dicit, in libro de Serm. Dom. in monte, videri ab hominibus nefas est, sed ideo haec agere ut ab hominibus videaris.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Chrysostom says [*Hom. xiii in the Opus Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom], "Our Lord forbids one to pray in presence of others in order that one may be seen by others. Hence when you pray, do nothing strange to draw men's attention, either by shouting so as to be heard by others, or by openly striking the heart, or extending the hands, so as to be seen by many. And yet, "according to Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 3), "it is not wrong to be seen by men, but to do this or that in order to be seen by men."

Ad tertiumdecimum sic proceditur. Videtur quod de necessitate orationis sit quod sit attenta. Dicitur enim Ioan. IV, spiritus est Deus, et eos qui adorant eum, in spiritu et veritate adorare oportet. Sed oratio non est in spiritu si non sit attenta. Ergo de necessitate orationis est quod sit attenta.
        


Objection 1:
 It would seem that attention is a necessary condition of prayer. It is written (
Jn. 4:24
): "God is a spirit, and they that adore Him must adore Him in spirit and in truth." But prayer is not in spirit unless it be attentive. Therefore attention is a necessary condition of prayer.




Praeterea, oratio est ascensus intellectus in Deum. Sed quando oratio non est attenta, intellectus non ascendit in Deum. Ergo de necessitate orationis est quod sit attenta.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, prayer is "the ascent of the mind to God" [*Damascene, De Fide Orth. iii, 24]. But the mind does not ascend to God if the prayer is inattentive. Therefore attention is a necessary condition of prayer.




Praeterea, de necessitate orationis est quod careat omni peccato. Sed non est absque peccato quod aliquis orando evagationem mentis patiatur, videtur eum deridere Deum, sicut et si alicui homini loqueretur et non attenderet ad ea quae ipse proferret. Unde Basilius dicit, est divinum auxilium implorandum non remisse, nec mente huc illuc evagante, eo quod talis non solum non impetrabit quod petit, sed et magis Deum irritabit. Ergo de necessitate orationis esse videtur quod sit attenta.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, it is a necessary condition of prayer that it should be altogether sinless. Now if a man allows his mind to wander while praying he is not free of sin, for he seems to make light of God; even as if he were to speak to another man without attending to what he was saying. Hence Basil says [*De Constit. Monach. i] that the "Divine assistance is to be implored, not lightly, nor with a mind wandering hither and thither: because he that prays thus not only will not obtain what he asks, nay rather will he provoke God to anger." Therefore it would seem a necessary condition of prayer that it should be attentive.




Sed contra est quod etiam sancti viri quandoque orantes evagationem mentis patiuntur, secundum illud Psalm., cor meum dereliquit me.
        
On the contrary,
 Even holy men sometimes suffer from a wandering of the mind when they pray, according to Ps. 39:13, "My heart hath forsaken me."




Respondeo dicendum quod quaestio haec praecipue locum habet in oratione vocali. Circa quam sciendum est quod necessarium dicitur aliquid dupliciter. Uno modo, per quod melius pervenitur ad finem. Et sic attentio absolute orationi necessaria est. Alio modo dicitur aliquid necessarium sine quo res non potest consequi suum effectum. Est autem triplex effectus orationis. Primus quidem communis omnibus actibus caritate informatis, quod est mereri. Et ad hunc effectum non ex necessitate requiritur quod attentio adsit orationi per totum, sed vis primae intentionis qua aliquis ad orandum accedit, reddit totam orationem meritoriam, sicut in aliis meritoriis actibus accidit. Secundus autem effectus orationis est ei proprius, quod est impetrare. Et ad hunc etiam effectum sufficit prima intentio, quam Deus principaliter attendit. Si autem prima intentio desit, oratio nec meritoria est nec impetrativa, illam enim orationem Deus non audit cui ille qui orat non intendit, ut Gregorius dicit. Tertius autem effectus orationis est quem praesentialiter efficit, scilicet quaedam spiritualis refectio mentis. Et ad hoc de necessitate requiritur in oratione attentio. Unde dicitur I Cor. XIV, si orem lingua, mens mea sine fructu est.
        


I answer that,
 This question applies chiefly to vocal prayer. Accordingly we must observe that a thing is necessary in two ways. First, a thing is necessary because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus attention is absolutely necessary for prayer. Secondly, a thing is said to be necessary when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now the effect of prayer is threefold. The first is an effect which is common to all acts quickened by charity, and this is merit. In order to realize this effect, it is not necessary that prayer should be attentive throughout; because the force of the original intention with which one sets about praying renders the whole prayer meritorious, as is the case with other meritorious acts. The second effect of prayer is proper thereto, and consists in impetration: and again the original intention, to which God looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the original intention is lacking, prayer lacks both merit and impetration: because, as Gregory [*Hugh St. Victor, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, "God hears not the prayer of those who pay no attention to their prayer." The third effect of prayer is that which it produces at once; this is the spiritual refreshment of the mind, and for this effect attention is a necessary condition: wherefore it is written (
1 Cor. 14:14
): "If I pray in a tongue... my understanding is without fruit."




Sciendum tamen quod est triplex attentio quae orationi vocali potest adhiberi. Una quidem qua attenditur ad verba, ne quis in eis erret. Secunda qua attenditur ad sensum verborum. Tertia qua attenditur ad finem orationis, scilicet ad Deum et ad rem pro qua oratur, quae quidem est maxime necessaria. Et hanc etiam possunt habere idiotae. Et quandoque intantum abundat haec intentio, qua mens fertur in Deum, ut etiam omnium aliorum mens obliviscatur, sicut dicit Hugo de sancto Victore.
        
It must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention that can be brought to vocal prayer: one which attends to the words, lest we say them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a third, which attends to the end of prayer, namely, God, and to the thing we are praying for. That last kind of attention is most necessary, and even idiots are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the mind is fixed on God, is sometimes so strong that the mind forgets all other things, as Hugh of St. Victor states [*De Modo Orandi ii].




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod in spiritu et veritate orat qui ex instinctu spiritus ad orandum accedit, etiam si ex aliqua infirmitate mens postmodum evagetur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 To pray in spirit and in truth is to set about praying through the instigation of the Spirit, even though afterwards the mind wander through weakness.




Ad secundum dicendum quod mens humana, propter infirmitatem naturae, diu in alto stare non potest, pondere enim infirmitatis humanae deprimitur anima ad inferiora. Et ideo contingit quod quando mens orantis ascendit in Deum per contemplationem, subito evagetur ex quadam infirmitate.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The human mind is unable to remain aloft for long on account of the weakness of nature, because human weakness weighs down the soul to the level of inferior things: and hence it is that when, while praying, the mind ascends to God by contemplation, of a sudden it wanders off through weakness.




Ad tertium dicendum quod si quis ex proposito in oratione mente evagetur, hoc peccatum est, et impedit orationis fructum. Et contra hoc Augustinus dicit, in regula, Psalmis et hymnis cum oratis Deum, hoc versetur in corde quod profertur in ore. Evagatio vero mentis quae fit praeter propositum, orationis fructum non tollit. Unde Basilius dicit, si vero, debilitatus a peccato, fixe nequis orare, quantumcumque potes teipsum cohibeas, et Deus ignoscit, eo quod non ex negligentia, sed ex fragilitate non potes, ut oportet, assistere coram eo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Purposely to allow one's mind to wander in prayer is sinful and hinders the prayer from having fruit. It is against this that Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "When you pray God with psalms and hymns, let your mind attend to that which your lips pronounce." But to wander in mind unintentionally does not deprive prayer of its fruit. Hence Basil says (De Constit. Monach. i): "If you are so truly weakened by sin that you are unable to pray attentively, strive as much as you can to curb yourself, and God will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to stand in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but through frailty."

Praeterea, oratio est ascensus intellectus in Deum. Sed quando oratio non est attenta, intellectus non ascendit in Deum. Ergo de necessitate orationis est quod sit attenta.

 The human mind is unable to remain aloft for long on account of the weakness of nature, because human weakness weighs down the soul to the level of inferior things: and hence it is that when, while praying, the mind ascends to God by contemplation, of a sudden it wanders off through weakness.




Ad tertium dicendum quod si quis ex proposito in oratione mente evagetur, hoc peccatum est, et impedit orationis fructum. Et contra hoc Augustinus dicit, in regula, Psalmis et hymnis cum oratis Deum, hoc versetur in corde quod profertur in ore. Evagatio vero mentis quae fit praeter propositum, orationis fructum non tollit. Unde Basilius dicit, si vero, debilitatus a peccato, fixe nequis orare, quantumcumque potes teipsum cohibeas, et Deus ignoscit, eo quod non ex negligentia, sed ex fragilitate non potes, ut oportet, assistere coram eo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Purposely to allow one's mind to wander in prayer is sinful and hinders the prayer from having fruit. It is against this that Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "When you pray God with psalms and hymns, let your mind attend to that which your lips pronounce." But to wander in mind unintentionally does not deprive prayer of its fruit. Hence Basil says (De Constit. Monach. i): "If you are so truly weakened by sin that you are unable to pray attentively, strive as much as you can to curb yourself, and God will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to stand in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but through frailty."

Respondeo dicendum quod quaestio haec praecipue locum habet in oratione vocali. Circa quam sciendum est quod necessarium dicitur aliquid dupliciter. Uno modo, per quod melius pervenitur ad finem. Et sic attentio absolute orationi necessaria est. Alio modo dicitur aliquid necessarium sine quo res non potest consequi suum effectum. Est autem triplex effectus orationis. Primus quidem communis omnibus actibus caritate informatis, quod est mereri. Et ad hunc effectum non ex necessitate requiritur quod attentio adsit orationi per totum, sed vis primae intentionis qua aliquis ad orandum accedit, reddit totam orationem meritoriam, sicut in aliis meritoriis actibus accidit. Secundus autem effectus orationis est ei proprius, quod est impetrare. Et ad hunc etiam effectum sufficit prima intentio, quam Deus principaliter attendit. Si autem prima intentio desit, oratio nec meritoria est nec impetrativa, illam enim orationem Deus non audit cui ille qui orat non intendit, ut Gregorius dicit. Tertius autem effectus orationis est quem praesentialiter efficit, scilicet quaedam spiritualis refectio mentis. Et ad hoc de necessitate requiritur in oratione attentio. Unde dicitur I Cor. XIV, si orem lingua, mens mea sine fructu est.
        


I answer that,
 This question applies chiefly to vocal prayer. Accordingly we must observe that a thing is necessary in two ways. First, a thing is necessary because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus attention is absolutely necessary for prayer. Secondly, a thing is said to be necessary when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now the effect of prayer is threefold. The first is an effect which is common to all acts quickened by charity, and this is merit. In order to realize this effect, it is not necessary that prayer should be attentive throughout; because the force of the original intention with which one sets about praying renders the whole prayer meritorious, as is the case with other meritorious acts. The second effect of prayer is proper thereto, and consists in impetration: and again the original intention, to which God looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the original intention is lacking, prayer lacks both merit and impetration: because, as Gregory [*Hugh St. Victor, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, "God hears not the prayer of those who pay no attention to their prayer." The third effect of prayer is that which it produces at once; this is the spiritual refreshment of the mind, and for this effect attention is a necessary condition: wherefore it is written (
1 Cor. 14:14
): "If I pray in a tongue... my understanding is without fruit."




Sciendum tamen quod est triplex attentio quae orationi vocali potest adhiberi. Una quidem qua attenditur ad verba, ne quis in eis erret. Secunda qua attenditur ad sensum verborum. Tertia qua attenditur ad finem orationis, scilicet ad Deum et ad rem pro qua oratur, quae quidem est maxime necessaria. Et hanc etiam possunt habere idiotae. Et quandoque intantum abundat haec intentio, qua mens fertur in Deum, ut etiam omnium aliorum mens obliviscatur, sicut dicit Hugo de sancto Victore.
        
It must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention that can be brought to vocal prayer: one which attends to the words, lest we say them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a third, which attends to the end of prayer, namely, God, and to the thing we are praying for. That last kind of attention is most necessary, and even idiots are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the mind is fixed on God, is sometimes so strong that the mind forgets all other things, as Hugh of St. Victor states [*De Modo Orandi ii].




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod in spiritu et veritate orat qui ex instinctu spiritus ad orandum accedit, etiam si ex aliqua infirmitate mens postmodum evagetur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 To pray in spirit and in truth is to set about praying through the instigation of the Spirit, even though afterwards the mind wander through weakness.




Ad secundum dicendum quod mens humana, propter infirmitatem naturae, diu in alto stare non potest, pondere enim infirmitatis humanae deprimitur anima ad inferiora. Et ideo contingit quod quando mens orantis ascendit in Deum per contemplationem, subito evagetur ex quadam infirmitate.

Ad septimumdecimum sic proceditur. Videtur quod inconvenienter dicantur esse orationis partes obsecrationes, orationes, postulationes, gratiarum actiones. Obsecratio enim videtur esse quaedam adiuratio. Sed, sicut Origenes dicit, super Matth., non oportet ut vir qui vult secundum Evangelium vivere, adiuret alium, si enim iurare non licet, nec adiurare. Ergo inconvenienter ponitur obsecratio orationis pars.
        
Objection 1:
 It would seem that the parts of prayer are unfittingly described as supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Supplication would seem to be a kind of adjuration. Yet, according to Origen (Super Matth. Tract. xxxv), "a man who wishes to live according to the gospel need not adjure another, for if it be unlawful to swear, it is also unlawful to adjure." Therefore supplication is unfittingly reckoned a part of prayer.




Praeterea, oratio, secundum Damascenum, est petitio decentium a Deo. Inconvenienter ergo orationes contra postulationes dividuntur.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "to pray is to ask becoming things of God." Therefore it is unfitting to distinguish "prayers" from "intercessions."




Praeterea, gratiarum actiones pertinent ad praeterita, alia vero ad futura. Sed praeterita sunt priora futuris. Inconvenienter ergo gratiarum actiones post alia ponuntur.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, thanksgivings regard the past, while the others regard the future. But the past precedes the future. Therefore thanksgivings are unfittingly placed after the others.




In contrarium est auctoritas apostoli, I ad Tim. II.
        


On the contrary,
 suffices the authority of the Apostle (
1 Tim. 2:1
).
      


Respondeo dicendum quod ad orationem tria requiruntur. Quorum primum est ut orans accedat ad Deum, quem orat. Quod significatur nomine orationis, quia oratio est ascensus intellectus in Deum. Secundo, requiritur petitio, quae significatur nomine postulationis, sive petitio proponatur determinate, quod quidem nominant quidam proprie postulationem; sive indeterminate, ut cum quis petit iuvari a Deo, quod nominant supplicationem; sive solum factum narretur, secundum illud Ioan. XI, ecce, quem amas infirmatur, quod vocant insinuationem. Tertio, requiritur ratio impetrandi quod petitur. Et hoc vel ex parte Dei, vel ex parte petentis. Ratio quidem impetrandi ex parte Dei est eius sanctitas, propter quam petimus exaudiri, secundum illud Dan. IX, propter temetipsum inclina, Deus meus, aurem tuam. Et ad hoc pertinet obsecratio, quae est per sacra contestatio, sicut cum dicimus, per nativitatem tuam, libera nos, domine. Ratio vero impetrandi ex parte petentis est gratiarum actio, quia de acceptis beneficiis gratias agentes, meremur accipere potiora, ut in collecta dicitur. Et ideo dicit Glossa, I ad Tim. II, quod in Missa obsecrationes sunt quae praecedunt consecrationem, in quibus quaedam sacra commemorantur; orationes sunt in ipsa consecratione, in qua mens maxime debet elevari in Deum; postulationes autem sunt in sequentibus petitionibus; gratiarum actiones in fine.
        
I answer that,
 Three conditions are requisite for prayer. First, that the person who prays should approach God Whom he prays: this is signified in the word "prayer," because prayer is "the raising up of one's mind to God." The second is that there should be a petition, and this is signified in the word "intercession." In this case sometimes one asks for something definite, and then some say it is "intercession" properly so called, or we may ask for some thing indefinitely, for instance to be helped by God, or we may simply indicate a fact, as in Jn. 11:3, "Behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick," and then they call it "insinuation." The third condition is the reason for impetrating what we ask for: and this either on the part of God, or on the part of the person who asks. The reason of impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of which we ask to be heard, according to Dan. 9:17,18, "For Thy own sake, incline, O God, Thy ear"; and to this pertains "supplication" [obsecratio] which means a pleading through sacred things, as when we say, "Through Thy nativity, deliver us, O Lord." The reason for impetration on the part of the person who asks is "thanksgiving"; since "through giving thanks for benefits received we merit to receive yet greater benefits," as we say in the collect [*Ember Friday in September and Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor Bishop]. Hence a gloss on 1 Tim. 2:1 says that "in the Mass, the consecration is preceded by supplication," in which certain sacred things are called to mind; that "prayers are in the consecration itself," in which especially the mind should be raised up to God; and that "intercessions are in the petitions that follow, and thanksgivings at the end."




In pluribus etiam Ecclesiae collectis haec quatuor possunt attendi. Sicut in collecta Trinitatis, quod dicitur, omnipotens, sempiterne Deus, pertinet ad orationis ascensum in Deum; quod dicitur, qui dedisti famulis tuis etc., pertinet ad gratiarum actionem; quod dicitur, praesta, quaesumus etc., pertinet ad postulationem; quod in fine ponitur, per dominum nostrum etc., pertinet ad obsecrationem.
        
We may notice these four things in several of the Church's collects. Thus in the collect of Trinity Sunday the words, "Almighty eternal God" belong to the offering up of prayer to God; the words, "Who hast given to Thy servants," etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, "grant, we beseech Thee," belong to intercession; and the words at the end, "Through Our Lord," etc. belong to supplication.




In collationibus autem patrum dicitur quod obsecratio est imploratio pro peccatis; oratio, cum aliquid Deo vovemus; postulatio, cum pro aliis petimus. Sed primum melius est.
        
In the "Conferences of the Fathers" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we read: "Supplication is bewailing one's sins; prayer is vowing something to God; intercession is praying for others; thanksgiving is offered by the mind to God in ineffable ecstasy." The first explanation, however, is the better.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod obsecratio non est adiuratio ad compellendum, quae prohibetur, sed ad misericordiam implorandum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 "Supplication" is an adjuration not for the purpose of compelling, for this is forbidden, but in order to implore mercy.




Ad secundum dicendum quod oratio communiter sumpta includit omnia quae hic dicuntur. Sed secundum quod contra alia dividitur, importat proprie ascensum in Deum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 "Prayer" in the general sense includes all the things mentioned here; but when distinguished from the others it denotes properly the ascent to God.




Ad tertium dicendum quod in diversis praeterita praecedunt futura, sed aliquid unum et idem prius est futurum quam sit praeteritum. Et ideo gratiarum actio de aliis beneficiis praecedit postulationem aliorum beneficiorum, sed idem beneficium prius postulatur, et ultimo, cum acceptum fuerit, de eo gratiae aguntur. Postulationem autem praecedit oratio, per quam acceditur ad eum a quo petimus. Orationem autem praecedit obsecratio, quia ex consideratione divinae bonitatis ad eum audemus accedere.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Among things that are diverse the past precedes the future; but the one and same thing is future before it is past. Hence thanksgiving for other benefits precedes intercession: but one and the same benefit is first sought, and finally, when it has been received, we give thanks for it. Intercession is preceded by prayer whereby we approach Him of Whom we ask: and prayer is preceded by supplication, whereby through the consideration of God's goodness we dare approach Him.

Praeterea, oratio, secundum Damascenum, est petitio decentium a Deo. Inconvenienter ergo orationes contra postulationes dividuntur.

In contrarium est auctoritas apostoli, I ad Tim. II.
        


On the contrary,
 suffices the authority of the Apostle (
1 Tim. 2:1
).
      


Respondeo dicendum quod ad orationem tria requiruntur. Quorum primum est ut orans accedat ad Deum, quem orat. Quod significatur nomine orationis, quia oratio est ascensus intellectus in Deum. Secundo, requiritur petitio, quae significatur nomine postulationis, sive petitio proponatur determinate, quod quidem nominant quidam proprie postulationem; sive indeterminate, ut cum quis petit iuvari a Deo, quod nominant supplicationem; sive solum factum narretur, secundum illud Ioan. XI, ecce, quem amas infirmatur, quod vocant insinuationem. Tertio, requiritur ratio impetrandi quod petitur. Et hoc vel ex parte Dei, vel ex parte petentis. Ratio quidem impetrandi ex parte Dei est eius sanctitas, propter quam petimus exaudiri, secundum illud Dan. IX, propter temetipsum inclina, Deus meus, aurem tuam. Et ad hoc pertinet obsecratio, quae est per sacra contestatio, sicut cum dicimus, per nativitatem tuam, libera nos, domine. Ratio vero impetrandi ex parte petentis est gratiarum actio, quia de acceptis beneficiis gratias agentes, meremur accipere potiora, ut in collecta dicitur. Et ideo dicit Glossa, I ad Tim. II, quod in Missa obsecrationes sunt quae praecedunt consecrationem, in quibus quaedam sacra commemorantur; orationes sunt in ipsa consecratione, in qua mens maxime debet elevari in Deum; postulationes autem sunt in sequentibus petitionibus; gratiarum actiones in fine.
        
I answer that,
 Three conditions are requisite for prayer. First, that the person who prays should approach God Whom he prays: this is signified in the word "prayer," because prayer is "the raising up of one's mind to God." The second is that there should be a petition, and this is signified in the word "intercession." In this case sometimes one asks for something definite, and then some say it is "intercession" properly so called, or we may ask for some thing indefinitely, for instance to be helped by God, or we may simply indicate a fact, as in Jn. 11:3, "Behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick," and then they call it "insinuation." The third condition is the reason for impetrating what we ask for: and this either on the part of God, or on the part of the person who asks. The reason of impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of which we ask to be heard, according to Dan. 9:17,18, "For Thy own sake, incline, O God, Thy ear"; and to this pertains "supplication" [obsecratio] which means a pleading through sacred things, as when we say, "Through Thy nativity, deliver us, O Lord." The reason for impetration on the part of the person who asks is "thanksgiving"; since "through giving thanks for benefits received we merit to receive yet greater benefits," as we say in the collect [*Ember Friday in September and Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor Bishop]. Hence a gloss on 1 Tim. 2:1 says that "in the Mass, the consecration is preceded by supplication," in which certain sacred things are called to mind; that "prayers are in the consecration itself," in which especially the mind should be raised up to God; and that "intercessions are in the petitions that follow, and thanksgivings at the end."




In pluribus etiam Ecclesiae collectis haec quatuor possunt attendi. Sicut in collecta Trinitatis, quod dicitur, omnipotens, sempiterne Deus, pertinet ad orationis ascensum in Deum; quod dicitur, qui dedisti famulis tuis etc., pertinet ad gratiarum actionem; quod dicitur, praesta, quaesumus etc., pertinet ad postulationem; quod in fine ponitur, per dominum nostrum etc., pertinet ad obsecrationem.
        
We may notice these four things in several of the Church's collects. Thus in the collect of Trinity Sunday the words, "Almighty eternal God" belong to the offering up of prayer to God; the words, "Who hast given to Thy servants," etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, "grant, we beseech Thee," belong to intercession; and the words at the end, "Through Our Lord," etc. belong to supplication.




In collationibus autem patrum dicitur quod obsecratio est imploratio pro peccatis; oratio, cum aliquid Deo vovemus; postulatio, cum pro aliis petimus. Sed primum melius est.
        
In the "Conferences of the Fathers" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we read: "Supplication is bewailing one's sins; prayer is vowing something to God; intercession is praying for others; thanksgiving is offered by the mind to God in ineffable ecstasy." The first explanation, however, is the better.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod obsecratio non est adiuratio ad compellendum, quae prohibetur, sed ad misericordiam implorandum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 "Supplication" is an adjuration not for the purpose of compelling, for this is forbidden, but in order to implore mercy.




Ad secundum dicendum quod oratio communiter sumpta includit omnia quae hic dicuntur. Sed secundum quod contra alia dividitur, importat proprie ascensum in Deum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 "Prayer" in the general sense includes all the things mentioned here; but when distinguished from the others it denotes properly the ascent to God.




Ad tertium dicendum quod in diversis praeterita praecedunt futura, sed aliquid unum et idem prius est futurum quam sit praeteritum. Et ideo gratiarum actio de aliis beneficiis praecedit postulationem aliorum beneficiorum, sed idem beneficium prius postulatur, et ultimo, cum acceptum fuerit, de eo gratiae aguntur. Postulationem autem praecedit oratio, per quam acceditur ad eum a quo petimus. Orationem autem praecedit obsecratio, quia ex consideratione divinae bonitatis ad eum audemus accedere.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Among things that are diverse the past precedes the future; but the one and same thing is future before it is past. Hence thanksgiving for other benefits precedes intercession: but one and the same benefit is first sought, and finally, when it has been received, we give thanks for it. Intercession is preceded by prayer whereby we approach Him of Whom we ask: and prayer is preceded by supplication, whereby through the consideration of God's goodness we dare approach Him.
