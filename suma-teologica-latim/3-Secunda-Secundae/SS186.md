# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod ex verbo illo non habetur quod continentia praeferatur omnibus aliis actibus virtuosis, sed coniugali castitati; vel etiam exterioribus divitiis auri et argenti, quae pondere mensurantur. Vel per continentiam intelligitur universaliter abstinentia ab omni malo, ut supra habitum est.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 The words quoted mean that continence is to be preferred, not to all other acts of virtue, but to conjugal chastity, or to external riches of gold and silver which are measured by weight [*'Pondere,' referring to the Latin 'ponderatio' in the Vulgate, which the Douay version renders 'price.']. Or again continence is taken in a general sense for abstinence from ali evil, as stated above (

Ad tertium dicendum quod Papa in voto obedientiae non potest sic cum religioso dispensare ut nulli praelato teneatur obedire in his quae ad perfectionem vitae pertinent, non enim potest eum a sua obedientia eximere. Potest tamen eum eximere ab inferioris praelati subiectione. Quod non est in voto obedientiae dispensare.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The Pope cannot dispense a religious from his vow of obedience so as to release him from obedience to every superior in matters relating to the perfection of life, for he cannot exempt him from obedience to himself. He can, however, exempt him from subjection to a lower superior, but this is not to dispense him from his vow of obedience.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod auctoritas illa loquitur de his quae per infirmitatem vel ignorantiam committuntur, non autem de his quae committuntur per contemptum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The words quoted refer to things done through weakness or ignorance, but not to those that are done out of contempt.




Ad secundum dicendum quod Iosaphat etiam, cui verba illa dicuntur, non ex malitia, sed ex quadam infirmitate humanae affectionis peccavit.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Josaphat also, to whom these words were addressed, sinned not out of contempt, but out of a certain weakness of human affection.




Ad tertium dicendum quod iusti non de facili peccant ex contemptu sed quandoque labuntur in aliquod peccatum ex ignorantia vel infirmitate, a quo de facili relevantur. Si autem ad hoc perveniant quod ex contemptu peccent, efficiuntur pessimi et maxime incorrigibiles, secundum illud Ierem. II, confregisti iugum, diripuisti vincula, dixisti, non serviam. In omni colle sublimi, et sub omni ligno frondoso, tu prosternebaris meretrix. Unde Augustinus dicit, in epistola ad plebem Hipponens., ex quo Deo servire coepi, quomodo difficile sum expertus meliores quam qui in monasteriis profecerunt, ita non sum expertus peiores quam qui in monasteriis ceciderunt.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The just sin not easily out of contempt; but sometimes they fall into a sin through ignorance or weakness from which they easily arise. If, however, they go so far as to sin out of contempt, they become most wicked and incorrigible, according to the word of Jeremias 2:20: "Thou hast broken My yoke, thou hast burst My bands, and thou hast said: 'I will not serve.' For on every high hill and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself." Hence Augustine says (Ep. lxxviii ad Pleb. Hippon.): "From the time I began to serve God, even as I scarcely found better men than those who made progress in monasteries, so have I not found worse than those who in the monastery have fallen."
