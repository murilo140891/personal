# Summa Theologica

Per se autem est activum scandalum quando aliquis suo inordinato dicto vel facto intendit alium trahere ad peccatum. Et sic ex intentione specialis finis sortitur rationem specialis peccati, finis enim dat speciem in moralibus, ut supra dictum est. Unde sicut furtum est speciale peccatum, aut homicidium, propter speciale nocumentum proximi quod intenditur; ita etiam scandalum est speciale peccatum, propter hoc quod intenditur speciale proximi nocumentum. Et opponitur directe correctioni fraternae, in qua attenditur specialis nocumenti remotio.
        

          Active scandal is direct when a man intends, by his inordinate word or deed, to draw another into sin, and then it becomes a special kind of sin on account of the intention of a special kind of end, because moral actions take their species from their end, as stated above (

Question [1]

Article [3]
;

Question [18]

Articles [4]
,6). Hence, just as theft and murder are special kinds of sin, on account of their denoting the intention of doing a special injury to one's neighbor: so too, scandal is a special kind of sin, because thereby a man intends a special harm to his neighbor, and it is directly opposed to fraternal correction, whereby a man intends the removal of a special kind of harm.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod omne peccatum potest materialiter se habere ad scandalum activum. Sed formalem rationem specialis peccati potest habere ex intentione finis, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Any sin may be the matter of active scandal, but it may derive the formal aspect of a special sin from the end intended, as stated above.
      


Ad secundum dicendum quod scandalum activum potest inveniri separatim ab aliis peccatis, ut puta cum aliquis proximum scandalizat facto quod de se non est peccatum, sed habet speciem mali.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Active scandal can be found separate from other sins, as when a man scandalizes his neighbor by a deed which is not a sin in itself, but has an appearance of evil.




Ad tertium dicendum quod scandalum non habet rationem specialis peccati ex praedicta circumstantia, sed ex intentione finis, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Scandal does not derive the species of a special sin from the circumstance in question, but from the intention of the end, as stated above.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, scandalum large ponitur ibi pro quolibet impedimento. Unde dominus Petro dicit, scandalum mihi es, quia nitebatur eius propositum impedire circa passionem subeundam.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 As stated above (
Article [2]
, ad 2), in this passage, scandal is used in a broad sense, to denote any kind of hindrance. Hence Our Lord said to Peter: "Thou art a scandal to Me," because he was endeavoring to weaken Our Lord's purpose of undergoing His Passion.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in exterioribus actibus perfecti viri possunt impediri. Sed in interiori voluntate per dicta vel facta aliorum non impediuntur quominus tendant in Deum, secundum illud Rom. VIII, neque mors neque vita poterit nos separare a caritate Dei.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Perfect men may be hindered in the performance of external actions. But they are not hindered by the words or deeds of others, from tending to God in the internal acts of the will, according to Rm. 8:38,39: "Neither death, nor life... shall be able to separate us from the love of God."




Ad tertium dicendum quod perfecti viri ex infirmitate carnis incidunt interdum in aliqua peccata venialia, non autem ex aliorum dictis vel factis scandalizantur secundum veram scandali rationem. Sed potest esse in eis quaedam appropinquatio ad scandalum, secundum illud Psalm., mei pene moti sunt pedes.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Perfect men sometimes fall into venial sins through the weakness of the flesh; but they are not scandalized (taking scandal in its true sense), by the words or deeds of others, although there can be an approach to scandal in them, according to Ps. 72:2: "My feet were almost moved."

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod scandalum passivum semper ab aliquo activo causatur, sed non semper ab aliquo scandalo activo alterius, sed eiusdem qui scandalizatur; quia scilicet ipse seipsum scandalizat.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Passive scandal is always due to some active scandal; yet this active scandal is not always in another, but in the very person who is scandalized, because, to wit, he scandalizes himself.




Ad secundum dicendum quod Petrus peccavit quidem, et reprehensibilis fuit, secundum sententiam Augustini et ipsius Pauli, subtrahens se a gentilibus ut vitaret scandalum Iudaeorum, quia hoc incaute aliqualiter faciebat, ita quod ex hoc gentiles ad fidem conversi scandalizabantur. Non tamen factum Petri erat tam grave peccatum quod merito possent alii scandalizari. Unde patiebantur scandalum passivum, non autem erat in Petro scandalum activum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 In the opinion of Augustine (Ep. xxviii, xl, lxxxii) and of Paul also, Peter sinned and was to be blamed, in withdrawing from the gentiles in order to avoid the scandal of the Jews, because he did this somewhat imprudently, so that the gentiles who had been converted to the faith were scandalized. Nevertheless Peter's action was not so grave a sin as to give others sufficient ground for scandal. Hence they were guilty of passive scandal, while there was no active scandal in Peter.




Ad tertium dicendum quod peccata venialia perfectorum praecipue consistunt in subitis motibus, qui, cum sint occulti, scandalizare non possunt. Si qua vero etiam in exterioribus dictis vel factis venialia peccata committant, tam levia sunt ut de se scandalizandi virtutem non habeant.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The venial sins of the perfect consist chiefly in sudden movements, which being hidden cannot give scandal. If, however, they commit any venial sins even in their external words or deeds, these are so slight as to be insufficient in themselves to give scandal.
