 Whether prophecy advanced in perfection as time went on?

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod discretio luminis intelligibilis non potest a nobis cognosci nisi secundum quod iudicatur per aliqua signa imaginaria vel sensibilia. Et ideo ex diversitate imaginatorum perpenditur diversitas intellectualis luminis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 We are unable to know how to distinguish the intellectual light, except by means of imaginary or sensible signs. Hence the difference in the intellectual light is gathered from the difference in the things presented to the imagination.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, prophetia non est per modum habitus immanentis, sed magis per modum passionis transeuntis. Unde non est inconveniens quod uni et eidem prophetae fiat revelatio prophetica diversis vicibus secundum diversos gradus.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 As stated above (
Question [171]
, 
Article [2]
), prophecy is by way, not of an abiding habit, but of a transitory passion; wherefore there is nothing inconsistent if one and the same prophet, at different times, receive various degrees of prophetic revelation.




Ad tertium dicendum quod dicta et facta de quibus ibi fit mentio, non pertinent ad revelationem prophetiae, sed ad denuntiationem, quae fit secundum dispositionem eorum quibus denuntiatur id quod prophetae revelatum est; et hoc fit quandoque per dicta, quandoque per facta. Denuntiatio autem et operatio miraculorum consequenter se habent ad prophetiam, ut supra dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The words and deeds mentioned there do not pertain to the prophetic revelation, but to the announcement, which is made according to the disposition of those to whom that which is revealed to the prophet is announced; and this is done sometimes by words, sometimes by deeds. Now this announcement, and the working of miracles, are something consequent upon prophecy, as stated above (
Question [171]
, 
Article [1]
).

Ad secundum dicendum quod illa signa illorum prophetarum fuerunt maiora secundum substantiam facti, sed tamen miracula Moysi fuerunt maiora secundum modum faciendi, quia sunt facta toti populo.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 These signs of the prophets mentioned were greater as to the substance of the thing done; yet the miracles of Moses were greater as regards the way in which they were done, since they were wrought on a whole people.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Ioannes pertinet ad novum testamentum, cuius ministri praeferuntur etiam ipsi Moysi, quasi magis revelate speculantes, ut habetur II ad Cor. III.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 John belongs to the New Testament, whose ministers take precedence even of Moses, since they are spectators of a fuller revelation, as stated in 2 Cor. 3.
