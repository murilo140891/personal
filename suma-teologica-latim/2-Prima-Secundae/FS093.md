# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod de voluntate Dei dupliciter possumus loqui. Uno modo, quantum ad ipsam voluntatem, et sic, cum voluntas Dei sit ipsa eius essentia, non subditur gubernationi divinae neque legi aeternae, sed est idem quod lex aeterna. Alio modo possumus loqui de voluntate divina quantum ad ipsa quae Deus vult circa creaturas, quae quidem subiecta sunt legi aeternae, inquantum horum ratio est in divina sapientia. Et ratione horum, voluntas Dei dicitur rationabilis. Alioquin, ratione sui ipsius, magis est dicenda ipsa ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 We may speak of God's will in two ways. First, as to the will itself: and thus, since God's will is His very Essence, it is subject neither to the Divine government, nor to the eternal law, but is the same thing as the eternal law. Secondly, we may speak of God's will, as to the things themselves that God wills about creatures; which things are subject to the eternal law, in so far as they are planned by Divine Wisdom. In reference to these things God's will is said to be reasonable [rationalis]: though regarded in itself it should rather be called their type [ratio].




Ad secundum dicendum quod filius Dei non est a Deo factus, sed naturaliter ab ipso genitus. Et ideo non subditur divinae providentiae aut legi aeternae, sed magis ipse est lex aeterna per quandam appropriationem, ut patet per Augustinum, in libro de vera Relig. Dicitur autem esse subiectus patri ratione humanae naturae, secundum quam etiam pater dicitur esse maior eo.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 God the Son was not made by God, but was naturally born of God. Consequently He is not subject to Divine providence or to the eternal law: but rather is Himself the eternal law by a kind of appropriation, as Augustine explains (De Vera Relig. xxxi). But He is said to be subject to the Father by reason of His human nature, in respect of which also the Father is said to be greater than He.




Tertium concedimus, quia procedit de necessariis creatis.
        
The third objection we grant, because it deals with those necessary things that are created.




Ad quartum dicendum quod, sicut philosophus dicit, in V Metaphys., quaedam necessaria habent causam suae necessitatis, et sic hoc ipsum quod impossibile est ea aliter esse, habent ab alio. Et hoc ipsum est cohibitio quaedam efficacissima, nam quaecumque cohibentur, intantum cohiberi dicuntur, inquantum non possunt aliter facere quam de eis disponatur.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 As the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 6), some necessary things have a cause of their necessity: and thus they derive from something else the fact that they cannot be otherwise. And this is in itself a most effective restraint; for whatever is restrained, is said to be restrained in so far as it cannot do otherwise than it is allowed to.

Ad tertium dicendum quod defectus qui accidunt in rebus naturalibus, quamvis sint praeter ordinem causarum particularium, non tamen sunt praeter ordinem causarum universalium; et praecipue causae primae, quae Deus est, cuius providentiam nihil subterfugere potest, ut in primo dictum est. Et quia lex aeterna est ratio divinae providentiae, ut dictum est, ideo defectus rerum naturalium legi aeternae subduntur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the defects which occur in natural things are outside the order of particular causes, they are not outside the order of universal causes, especially of the First Cause, i.e. God, from Whose providence nothing can escape, as stated in the FP, Question [22], Article [2]. And since the eternal law is the type of Divine providence, as stated above (
Article [1]
), hence the defects of natural things are subject to the eternal law.
