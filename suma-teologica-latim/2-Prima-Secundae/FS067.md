# Summa Theologica

Deinde considerandum est de duratione virtutum post hanc vitam. Et circa hoc quaeruntur sex.
        
We must now consider the duration of virtues after this life, under which head there are six points of inquiry:




Primo, utrum virtutes morales maneant post hanc vitam.
        


(1)
 Whether the moral virtues remain after this life?
      


Secundo, utrum virtutes intellectuales.
        


(2)
 Whether the intellectual virtues remain?
      


Tertio, utrum fides.
        


(3)
 Whether faith remains?
      


Quarto, utrum remaneat spes.
        


(4)
 Whether hope remains?
      


Quinto, utrum aliquid fidei maneat, vel spei.
        


(5)
 Whether anything remains of faith or hope?
      


Sexto, utrum maneat caritas.
        


(6)
 Whether charity remains?

Unde quantum ad ipsa phantasmata, quae sunt quasi materialia in virtutibus intellectualibus, virtutes intellectuales destruuntur, destructo corpore, sed quantum ad species intelligibiles, quae sunt in intellectu possibili, virtutes intellectuales manent. Species autem se habent in virtutibus intellectualibus sicut formales. Unde intellectuales virtutes manent post hanc vitam, quantum ad id quod est formale in eis, non autem quantum ad id quod est materiale, sicut et de moralibus dictum est.
        

          And yet the phantasms, by turning to which man understands in this life, by applying the intelligible species to them as stated in the FP, Question [84], Article [7]; FP, Question [85], Article [1], ad 5, cease as soon as the body is corrupted. Hence, so far as the phantasms are concerned, which are the quasi-material element in the intellectual virtues, these latter cease when the body is destroyed: but as regards the intelligible species, which are in the "possible" intellect, the intellectual virtues remain. Now the species are the quasi-formal element of the intellectual virtues. Therefore these remain after this life, as regards their formal element, just as we have stated concerning the moral virtues (
Article [1]
).




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod verbum apostoli est intelligendum quantum ad id quod est materiale in scientia, et quantum ad modum intelligendi, quia scilicet neque phantasmata remanebunt, destructo corpore; neque erit usus scientiae per conversionem ad phantasmata.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The saying of the Apostle is to be understood as referring to the material element in science, and to the mode of understanding; because, to it, neither do the phantasms remain, when the body is destroyed; nor will science be applied by turning to the phantasms.




Ad secundum dicendum quod per aegritudinem corrumpitur habitus scientiae quantum ad id quod est materiale in eo, scilicet quantum ad phantasmata, non autem quantum ad species intelligibiles, quae sunt in intellectu possibili.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Sickness destroys the habit of science as to its material element, viz. the phantasms, but not as to the intelligible species, which are in the "possible" intellect.




Ad tertium dicendum quod anima separata post mortem habet alium modum intelligendi quam per conversionem ad phantasmata, ut in primo dictum est. Et sic scientia manet, non tamen secundum eundem modum operandi, sicut et de virtutibus moralibus dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 As stated in the FP, Question [89], Article [1] the separated soul has a mode of understanding, other than by turning to the phantasms. Consequently science remains, yet not as to the same mode of operation; as we have stated concerning the moral virtues (
Article [1]
).

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod fides est nobilior quam scientia, ex parte obiecti, quia eius obiectum est veritas prima. Sed scientia habet perfectiorem modum cognoscendi, qui non repugnat perfectioni beatitudinis, scilicet visioni, sicut repugnat ei modus fidei.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Faith is more excellent than science, on the part of the object, because its object is the First Truth. Yet science has a more perfect mode of knowing its object, which is not incompatible with vision which is the perfection of happiness, as the mode of faith is incompatible.




Ad secundum dicendum quod fides est fundamentum quantum ad id quod habet de cognitione. Et ideo quando perficietur cognitio, erit perfectius fundamentum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Faith is the foundation in as much as it is knowledge: consequently when this knowledge is perfected, the foundation will be perfected also.




Ad tertium patet solutio ex his quae dicta sunt.
        
The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.
