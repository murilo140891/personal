# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod illa obiectio procedit de lege nova non quantum ad id quod est principale in ipsa, sed quantum ad id quod est secundarium in ipsa, scilicet quantum ad documenta et praecepta exterius homini proposita vel verbo vel scripto.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument holds true of the New Law, not as to its principal, but as to its secondary element: i.e. as to the dogmas and precepts outwardly put before man either in words or in writing.




Ad secundum dicendum quod gratia novi testamenti, etsi adiuvet hominem ad non peccandum, non tamen ita confirmat in bono ut homo peccare non possit, hoc enim pertinet ad statum gloriae. Et ideo si quis post acceptam gratiam novi testamenti peccaverit, maiori poena est dignus, tanquam maioribus beneficiis ingratus, et auxilio sibi dato non utens. Nec tamen propter hoc dicitur quod lex nova iram operatur, quia quantum est de se, sufficiens auxilium dat ad non peccandum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although the grace of the New Testament helps man to avoid sin, yet it does not so confirm man in good that he cannot sin: for this belongs to the state of glory. Hence if a man sin after receiving the grace of the New Testament, he deserves greater punishment, as being ungrateful for greater benefits, and as not using the help given to him. And this is why the New Law is not said to "work wrath": because as far as it is concerned it gives man sufficient help to avoid sin.




Ad tertium dicendum quod legem novam et veterem unus Deus dedit, sed aliter et aliter. Nam legem veterem dedit scriptam in tabulis lapideis, legem autem novam dedit scriptam in tabulis cordis carnalibus, ut apostolus dicit, II ad Cor. III. Proinde sicut Augustinus dicit, in libro de spiritu et littera, litteram istam extra hominem scriptam, et ministrationem mortis et ministrationem damnationis apostolus appellat. Hanc autem, scilicet novi testamenti legem, ministrationem spiritus et ministrationem iustitiae dicit, quia per donum spiritus operamur iustitiam, et a praevaricationis damnatione liberamur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The same God gave both the New and the Old Law, but in different ways. For He gave the Old Law written on tables of stone: whereas He gave the New Law written "in the fleshly tables of the heart," as the Apostle expresses it (
2 Cor. 3:3
). Wherefore, as Augustine says (De Spir. et Lit. xviii), "the Apostle calls this letter which is written outside man, a ministration of death and a ministration of condemnation: whereas he calls the other letter, i.e. the Law of the New Testament, the ministration of the spirit and the ministration of justice: because through the gift of the Spirit we work justice, and are delivered from the condemnation due to transgression."

Ad secundum dicendum quod diversitas locorum non variat diversum statum humani generis, qui variatur per temporis successionem. Et ideo omnibus locis proponitur lex nova, non autem omnibus temporibus, licet omni tempore fuerint aliqui ad novum testamentum pertinentes, ut supra dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 The state of mankind does not vary according to diversity of place, but according to succession of time. Hence the New Law avails for all places, but not for all times: although at all times there have been some persons belonging to the New Testament, as stated above (
Article [1]
, ad 3).
      


Ad tertium dicendum quod ea quae pertinent ad salutem corporalem, deserviunt homini quantum ad naturam, quae non tollitur per peccatum. Sed ea quae pertinent ad spiritualem salutem, ordinantur ad gratiam, quae amittitur per peccatum. Et ideo non est similis ratio de utrisque.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Things pertaining to the health of the body are of service to man as regards his nature, which sin does not destroy: whereas things pertaining to the health of the soul are ordained to grace, which is forfeit through sin. Consequently the comparison will not hold.

Ad quartum dicendum quod, cum Christus statim in principio evangelicae praedicationis dixerit, appropinquavit regnum caelorum, stultissimum est dicere quod Evangelium Christi non sit Evangelium regni. Sed praedicatio Evangelii Christi potest intelligi dupliciter. Uno modo, quantum ad divulgationem notitiae Christi, et sic praedicatum fuit Evangelium in universo orbe etiam tempore apostolorum, ut Chrysostomus dicit. Et secundum hoc, quod additur, et tunc erit consummatio, intelligitur de destructione Ierusalem, de qua tunc ad litteram loquebatur. Alio modo potest intelligi praedicatio Evangelii in universo orbe cum pleno effectu, ita scilicet quod in qualibet gente fundetur Ecclesia. Et ita, sicut dicit Augustinus, in epistola ad Hesych., nondum est praedicatum Evangelium in universo orbe, sed, hoc facto, veniet consummatio mundi.
        


Reply to Objection 4:
 Since Christ said at the very outset of the preaching of the Gospel: "The kingdom of heaven is at hand" (
Mt. 4:17
), it is most absurd to say that the Gospel of Christ is not the Gospel of the kingdom. But the preaching of the Gospel of Christ may be understood in two ways. First, as denoting the spreading abroad of the knowledge of Christ: and thus the Gospel was preached throughout the world even at the time of the apostles, as Chrysostom states (Hom. lxxv in Matth.). And in this sense the words that follow—"and then shall the consummation come," refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, of which He was speaking literally. Secondly, the preaching of the Gospel may be understood as extending throughout the world and producing its full effect, so that, to wit, the Church would be founded in every nation. And in these sense, as Augustine writes to Hesychius (Epist. cxcix), the Gospel is not preached to the whole world yet, but, when it is, the consummation of the world will come.
