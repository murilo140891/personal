# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de causa timoris ex parte causae efficientis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument is true of the cause of fear, on the part of the efficient cause.




Ad secundum dicendum quod illi qui iam decapitantur, sunt in passione praesentis mali. Et ideo iste defectus excedit mensuram timoris.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Those who are already being executed, are actually suffering from a present evil; wherefore their defect exceeds the measure of fear.




Ad tertium dicendum quod decertantes timent non propter potentiam, qua decertare possunt, sed propter defectum potentiae, ex quo contingit quod se superaturos non confidunt.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Those who contend with one another are afraid, not on account of the power which enables them to contend: but on account of the lack of power, owing to which they are not confident of victory.
