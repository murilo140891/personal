# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod imitatio in divinis personis non significat posterioritatem, sed solam assimilationem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Imitation in God does not signify posteriority, but only assimilation.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Damascenus et alii doctores Graecorum communiter utuntur nomine imaginis pro perfecta similitudine.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Damascene and the other Greek Doctors commonly employ the term image as meaning a perfect similitude.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, licet spiritus sanctus sit similis patri et filio, non tamen sequitur quod sit imago, ratione iam dicta.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although the Holy Ghost is like to the Father and the Son, still it does not follow that He is the Image, as above explained.




Ad tertium dicendum quod imago alicuius dupliciter in aliquo invenitur. Uno modo, in re eiusdem naturae secundum speciem, ut imago regis invenitur in filio suo. Alio modo, in re alterius naturae, sicut imago regis invenitur in denario. Primo autem modo, filius est imago patris, secundo autem modo dicitur homo imago Dei. Et ideo ad designandam in homine imperfectionem imaginis, homo non solum dicitur imago, sed ad imaginem, per quod motus quidam tendentis in perfectionem designatur. Sed de filio Dei non potest dici quod sit ad imaginem, quia est perfecta patris imago.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The image of a thing may be found in something in two ways. In one way it is found in something of the same specific nature; as the image of the king is found in his son. In another way it is found in something of a different nature, as the king's image on the coin. In the first sense the Son is the Image of the Father; in the second sense man is called the image of God; and therefore in order to express the imperfect character of the divine image in man, man is not simply called the image, but "to the image," whereby is expressed a certain movement of tendency to perfection. But it cannot be said that the Son of God is "to the image," because He is the perfect Image of the Father.
