# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Boetius intelligit per formas quae sunt sine materia, rationes rerum quae sunt in mente divina, sicut etiam apostolus dicit, Heb. XI, fide credimus aptata esse saecula verbo Dei, ut ex invisibilibus visibilia fierent. Si tamen per formas quae sunt sine materia, intelligit Angelos, dicendum est quod ab eis veniunt formae quae sunt in materia, non per influxum, sed per motum.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 By immaterial forms Boethius understands the types of things in the mind of God. Thus the Apostle says (
Heb. 11:3
): "By faith we understand that the world was framed by the Word of God; that from invisible things visible things might be made." But if by immaterial forms he understands the angels, we say that from them come material forms, not by emanation, but by motion.




Ad secundum dicendum quod formae participatae in materia reducuntur, non ad formas aliquas per se subsistentes rationis eiusdem, ut Platonici posuerunt; sed ad formas intelligibiles vel intellectus angelici, a quibus per motum procedunt; vel ulterius ad rationes intellectus divini, a quibus etiam formarum semina sunt rebus creatis indita, ut per motum in actum educi possint.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Forms received into matter are to be referred, not to self-subsisting forms of the same type, as the Platonists held, but either to intelligible forms of the angelic intellect, from which they proceed by movement, or, still higher, to the types in the Divine intellect, by which the seeds of forms are implanted in created things, that they may be able to be brought by movement into act.




Ad tertium dicendum quod corpora caelestia causant formas in istis inferioribus, non influendo, sed movendo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The heavenly bodies inform earthly ones by movement, not by emanation.
