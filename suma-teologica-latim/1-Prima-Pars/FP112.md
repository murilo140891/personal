# Summa Theologica

Quarto, de quibus ordinibus mittantur.
        


(4)
 From what orders they are sent.

Ad tertium dicendum quod divinae personae non mittuntur in ministerium, sed aequivoce mitti dicuntur; ut ex praedictis patet.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry, but are said to be sent in an equivocal sense, as appears from what has been said (
Question [43]
, 
Article [1]
).




Ad quartum dicendum quod in divinis ministeriis est multiplex gradus. Unde nihil prohibet etiam inaequales Angelos immediate ad ministeria mitti; ita tamen quod superiores mittantur ad altiora ministeria, inferiores vero ad inferiora.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 A manifold grade exists in the Divine ministries. Hence there is nothing to prevent angels though unequal from being sent immediately in ministry, in such a manner however that the superior are sent to the higher ministries, and the lower to the inferior ministries.
