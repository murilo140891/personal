# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Deus usque modo operatur, conservando et administrando creaturam conditam, non autem novam creaturam condendo.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 God indeed "worketh until now" by preserving and providing for the creatures He has made, but not by the making of new ones.




Ad secundum dicendum quod requies non opponitur labori sive motui, sed productioni novarum rerum, et desiderio in aliud tendenti, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Rest is here not opposed to labor or to movement, but to the production of new creatures, and to the desire tending to an external object.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Deus in solo se requiescit, et se fruendo beatus est; ita et nos per solam Dei fruitionem beati efficimur. Et sic etiam facit nos a suis et nostris operibus in seipso requiescere. Est ergo conveniens expositio, ut dicatur Deus requievisse, quia nos requiescere facit. Sed non est haec sola ponenda, sed alia expositio est principalior et prior.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Even as God rests in Himself alone and is happy in the enjoyment of Himself, so our own sole happiness lies in the enjoyment of God. Thus, also, He makes us find rest in Himself, both from His works and our own. It is not, then, unreasonable to say that God rested in giving rest to us. Still, this explanation must not be set down as the only one, and the other is the first and principal explanation.
