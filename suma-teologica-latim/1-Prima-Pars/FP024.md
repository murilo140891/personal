# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod deletio, ut dictum est, non refertur ad librum vitae ex parte praescientiae, quasi in Deo sit aliqua mutabilitas, sed ex parte praescitorum, quae sunt mutabilia.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The act of blotting out does not refer to the book of life as regards God's foreknowledge, as if in God there were any change; but as regards things foreknown, which can change.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, licet res in Deo sint immutabiliter, tamen in seipsis mutabiles sunt. Et ad hoc pertinet deletio libri vitae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although things are immutably in God, yet in themselves they are subject to change. To this it is that the blotting out of the book of life refers.




Ad tertium dicendum quod eo modo quo aliquis dicitur deleri de libro vitae, potest dici quod ibi scribatur de novo; vel secundum opinionem hominum, vel secundum quod de novo incipit habere ordinem ad vitam aeternam per gratiam. Quod etiam sub divina notitia comprehenditur, licet non de novo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The way in which one is said to be blotted out of the book of life is that in which one is said to be written therein anew; either in the opinion of men, or because he begins again to have relation towards eternal life through grace; which also is included in the knowledge of God, although not anew.
