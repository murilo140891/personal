# Summa Theologica

Modus autem quo intellectus Angeli singularia cognoscit, ex hoc considerari potest quod, sicut a Deo effluunt res ut subsistant in propriis naturis, ita etiam ut sint in cognitione angelica. Manifestum est autem quod a Deo effluit in rebus non solum illud quod ad naturam universalem pertinet, sed etiam ea quae sunt individuationis principia, est enim causa totius substantiae rei, et quantum ad materiam et quantum ad formam. Et secundum quod causat, sic et cognoscit, quia scientia eius est causa rei, ut supra ostensum est. Sicut igitur Deus per essentiam suam, per quam omnia causat, est similitudo omnium, et per eam omnia cognoscit non solum quantum ad naturas universales, sed etiam quantum ad singularitatem; ita Angeli per species a Deo inditas, res cognoscunt non solum quantum ad naturam universalem, sed etiam secundum earum singularitatem, inquantum sunt quaedam repraesentationes multiplicatae illius unicae et simplicis essentiae.
        

          The manner in which an angel knows singular things can be considered from this, that, as things proceed from God in order that they may subsist in their own natures, so likewise they proceed in order that they may exist in the angelic mind. Now it is clear that there comes forth from God not only whatever belongs to their universal nature, but likewise all that goes to make up their principles of individuation; since He is the cause of the entire substance of the thing, as to both its matter and its form. And for as much as He causes, does He know; for His knowledge is the cause of a thing, as was shown above (
Question [14]
, 
Article [8]
). Therefore as by His essence, by which He causes all things, God is the likeness of all things, and knows all things, not only as to their universal natures, but also as to their singularity; so through the species imparted to them do the angels know things, not only as to their universal nature, but likewise in their individual conditions, in so far as they are the manifold representations of that one simple essence.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod philosophus loquitur de intellectu nostro, qui non intelligit res nisi abstrahendo; et per ipsam abstractionem a materialibus conditionibus, id quod abstrahitur, fit universale. Hic autem modus intelligendi non convenit Angelis, ut supra dictum est, et ideo non est eadem ratio.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 The Philosopher is speaking of our intellect, which apprehends only by a process of abstraction; and by such abstraction from material conditions the thing abstracted becomes a universal. Such a manner of understanding is not in keeping with the nature of the angels, as was said above (
Question [55]
, 
Article [2]
, 
Article [3]
 ad 1), and consequently there is no comparison.




Ad secundum dicendum quod secundum suam naturam Angeli non assimilantur rebus materialibus sicut assimilatur aliquid alicui secundum convenientiam in genere vel in specie, aut in accidente; sed sicut superius habet similitudinem cum inferiori, ut sol cum igne. Et per hunc etiam modum in Deo est similitudo omnium, et quantum ad formam et quantum ad materiam, inquantum in ipso praeexistit ut in causa quidquid in rebus invenitur. Et eadem ratione species intellectus Angeli, quae sunt quaedam derivatae similitudines a divina essentia, sunt similitudines rerum non solum quantum ad formam, sed etiam quantum ad materiam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 It is not according to their nature that the angels are likened to material things, as one thing resembles another by agreement in genus, species, or accident; but as the higher bears resemblance to the lower, as the sun does to fire. Even in this way there is in God a resemblance of all things, as to both matter and form, in so far as there pre-exists in Him as in its cause whatever is to be found in things. For the same reason, the species in the angel's intellect, which are images drawn from the Divine essence, are the images of things not only as to their form, but also as to their matter.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Angeli cognoscunt singularia per formas universales, quae tamen sunt similitudines rerum et quantum ad principia universalia, et quantum ad individuationis principia. Quomodo autem per eandem speciem possint multa cognosci iam supra dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Angels know singulars by universal forms, which nevertheless are the images of things both as to their universal, and as to their individuating principles. How many things can be known by the same species, has been already stated above (
Question [55]
, 
Article [3]
, ad 3).

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod homines non cognoscunt futura nisi in causis suis, vel Deo revelante. Et sic Angeli multo subtilius futura cognoscunt.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Men cannot know future things except in their causes, or by God's revelation. The angels know the future in the same way, but much more distinctly.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, licet intellectus Angeli sit supra tempus quo mensurantur corporales motus, est tamen in intellectu Angeli tempus secundum successionem intelligibilium conceptionum; secundum quod dicit Augustinus, VIII super Gen. ad Litt., quod Deus movet spiritualem creaturam per tempus. Et ita, cum sit successio in intellectu Angeli, non omnia quae aguntur per totum tempus, sunt ei praesentia.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although the angel's intellect is above that time according to which corporeal movements are reckoned, yet there is a time in his mind according to the succession of intelligible concepts; of which Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii) that "God moves the spiritual creature according to time." And thus, since there is succession in the angel's intellect, not all things that happen through all time, are present to the angelic mind.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, licet species quae sunt in intellectu Angeli, quantum est de se, aequaliter se habeant ad praesentia, praeterita et futura; tamen praesentia, praeterita et futura non aequaliter se habent ad rationes. Quia ea quae praesentia sunt, habent naturam per quam assimilantur speciebus quae sunt in mente Angeli, et sic per eas cognosci possunt. Sed quae futura sunt, nondum habent naturam per quam illis assimilentur, unde per eas cognosci non possunt.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the species in the intellect of an angel, in so far as they are species, refer equally to things present, past, and future; nevertheless the present, past, and future; nevertheless the present, past, and future do not bear the same relations to the species. Present things have a nature according to which they resemble the species in the mind of an angel: and so they can be known thereby. Things which are yet to come have not yet a nature whereby they are likened to such species; consequently, they cannot be known by those species.




Ad quartum dicendum quod distantia secundum locum sunt iam in rerum natura, et participant aliquam speciem, cuius similitudo est in Angelo, quod non est verum de futuris, ut dictum est. Et ideo non est simile.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Things distant according to place are already existing in nature; and share in some species, whose image is in the angel; whereas this is not true of future things, as has been stated. Consequently there is no comparison.
