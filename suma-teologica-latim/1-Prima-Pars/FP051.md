# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod Gregorius nominat Angelum rationale animal metaphorice, propter similitudinem rationis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Gregory calls the angel a rational animal metaphorically, on account of the likeness to the rational nature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod vivificare effective simpliciter perfectionis est. Unde et Deo convenit secundum illud I Reg. II, dominus mortificat et vivificat. Sed vivificare formaliter est substantiae quae est pars alicuius naturae, et non habentis in se integram naturam speciei. Unde substantia intellectualis quae non est unita corpori, est perfectior quam ea quae est corpori unita.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 To give life effectively is a perfection simply speaking; hence it belongs to God, as is said (
1 Kgs. 2:6
): "The Lord killeth, and maketh alive." But to give life formally belongs to a substance which is part of some nature, and which has not within itself the full nature of the species. Hence an intellectual substance which is not united to a body is more perfect than one which is united to a body.
