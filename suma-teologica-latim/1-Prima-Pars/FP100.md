# Summa Theologica

Deinde considerandum est de conditione prolis generandae quantum ad iustitiam. Et circa hoc quaeruntur duo.
        
We now have to consider the condition of the offspring as to righteousness. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:




Primo, utrum homines fuissent nati cum iustitia.
        


(1)
 Whether men would have been born in a state of righteousness?
      


Secundo, utrum nascerentur in iustitia confirmati.
        


(2)
 Whether they would have been born confirmed in righteousness?
