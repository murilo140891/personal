# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod proprietates dicuntur esse in essentia, per modum identitatis tantum. In personis autem dicuntur esse per modum identitatis, non quidem secundum rem tantum, sed quantum ad modum significandi, sicut forma in supposito. Et ideo proprietates determinant et distinguunt personas, non autem essentiam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The properties are said to be in the essence, only by mode of identity; but in the persons they exist by mode of identity, not merely in reality, but also in the mode of signification; as the form exists in its subject. Thus the properties determine and distinguish the persons, but not the essence.




Ad tertium dicendum quod participia et verba notionalia significant actus notionales. Actus autem suppositorum sunt. Proprietates autem non significantur ut supposita, sed ut formae suppositorum. Et ideo modus significandi repugnat, ut participia et verba notionalia de proprietatibus praedicentur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Notional participles and verbs signify the notional acts: and acts belong to a "suppositum." Now, properties are not designated as "supposita," but as forms of "supposita." And so their mode of signification is against notional participles and verbs being predicated of the properties.

Sed hoc non potest stare, propter duo. Primo quidem, quia ad hoc quod aliqua duo distincta intelligantur, necesse est eorum distinctionem intelligi per aliquid intrinsecum utrique; sicut in rebus creatis vel per materiam, vel per formam. Origo autem alicuius rei non significatur ut aliquid intrinsecum, sed ut via quaedam a re vel ad rem, sicut generatio significatur ut via quaedam ad rem genitam, et ut progrediens a generante. Unde non potest esse quod res genita et generans distinguantur sola generatione, sed oportet intelligere tam in generante quam in genito ea quibus ab invicem distinguuntur. In persona autem divina non est aliud intelligere nisi essentiam et relationem sive proprietatem. Unde, cum in essentia conveniant, relinquitur quod per relationes personae ab invicem distinguantur. Secundo, quia distinctio in divinis personis non est sic intelligenda, quasi aliquid commune dividatur, quia essentia communis remanet indivisa, sed oportet quod ipsa distinguentia constituant res distinctas. Sic autem relationes vel proprietates distinguunt vel constituunt hypostases vel personas, inquantum sunt ipsae personae subsistentes, sicut paternitas est pater, et filiatio est filius, eo quod in divinis non differt abstractum et concretum. Sed contra rationem originis est, quod constituat hypostasim vel personam. Quia origo active significata, significatur ut progrediens a persona subsistente, unde praesupponit eam. Origo autem passive significata, ut nativitas, significatur ut via ad personam subsistentem; et nondum ut eam constituens.
        
This opinion, however, cannot stand—for two reasons. Firstly, because, in order that two things be understood as distinct, their distinction must be understood as resulting from something intrinsic to both; thus in things created it results from their matter or their form. Now origin of a thing does not designate anything intrinsic, but means the way from something, or to something; as generation signifies the way to a thing generated, and as proceeding from the generator. Hence it is not possible that what is generated and the generator should be distinguished by generation alone; but in the generator and in the thing generated we must presuppose whatever makes them to be distinguished from each other. In a divine person there is nothing to presuppose but essence, and relation or property. Whence, since the persons agree in essence, it only remains to be said that the persons are distinguished from each other by the relations. Secondly: because the distinction of the divine persons is not to be so understood as if what is common to them all is divided, because the common essence remains undivided; but the distinguishing principles themselves must constitute the things which are distinct. Now the relations or the properties distinguish or constitute the hypostases or persons, inasmuch as they are themselves the subsisting persons; as paternity is the Father, and filiation is the Son, because in God the abstract and the concrete do not differ. But it is against the nature of origin that it should constitute hypostasis or person. For origin taken in an active sense signifies proceeding from a subsisting person, so that it presupposes the latter; while in a passive sense origin, as "nativity," signifies the way to a subsisting person, and as not yet constituting the person.




Unde melius dicitur quod personae seu hypostases distinguantur relationibus, quam per originem. Licet enim distinguantur utroque modo, tamen prius et principalius per relationes, secundum modum intelligendi. Unde hoc nomen pater non solum significat proprietatem, sed etiam hypostasim, sed hoc nomen genitor, vel generans, significat tantum proprietatem. Quia hoc nomen pater significat relationem, quae est distinctiva et constitutiva hypostasis, hoc autem nomen generans, vel genitus, significat originem, quae non est distinctiva et constitutiva hypostasis.
        
It is therefore better to say that the persons or hypostases are distinguished rather by relations than by origin. For, although in both ways they are distinguished, nevertheless in our mode of understanding they are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations; whence this name "Father" signifies not only a property, but also the hypostasis; whereas this term "Begetter" or "Begetting" signifies property only; forasmuch as this name "Father" signifies the relation which is distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis; and this term "Begetter" or "Begotten" signifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod personae sunt ipsae relationes subsistentes. Unde non repugnat simplicitati divinarum personarum, quod relationibus distinguantur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The persons are the subsisting relations themselves. Hence it is not against the simplicity of the divine persons for them to be distinguished by the relations.




Ad secundum dicendum quod personae divinae non distinguuntur in esse in quo subsistunt, neque in aliquo absoluto, sed solum secundum id quod ad aliquid dicuntur. Unde ad earum distinctionem sufficit relatio.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The divine persons are not distinguished as regards being, in which they subsist, nor in anything absolute, but only as regards something relative. Hence relation suffices for their distinction.




Ad tertium dicendum quod quanto distinctio prior est, tanto propinquior est unitati. Et ideo debet esse minima. Et ideo distinctio personarum non debet esse nisi per id quod minimum distinguit, scilicet per relationem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The more prior a distinction is, the nearer it approaches to unity; and so it must be the least possible distinction. So the distinction of the persons must be by that which distinguishes the least possible; and this is by relation.




Ad quartum dicendum quod relatio praesupponit distinctionem suppositorum, quando est accidens, sed si relatio sit subsistens, non praesupponit, sed secum fert distinctionem. Cum enim dicitur quod relativi esse est ad aliud se habere, per ly aliud intelligitur correlativum, quod non est prius, sed simul natura,
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Relation presupposes the distinction of the subjects, when it is an accident; but when the relation is subsistent, it does not presuppose, but brings about distinction. For when it is said that relation is by nature to be towards another, the word "another" signifies the correlative which is not prior, but simultaneous in the order of nature.

Unde melius dicitur quod personae seu hypostases distinguantur relationibus, quam per originem. Licet enim distinguantur utroque modo, tamen prius et principalius per relationes, secundum modum intelligendi. Unde hoc nomen pater non solum significat proprietatem, sed etiam hypostasim, sed hoc nomen genitor, vel generans, significat tantum proprietatem. Quia hoc nomen pater significat relationem, quae est distinctiva et constitutiva hypostasis, hoc autem nomen generans, vel genitus, significat originem, quae non est distinctiva et constitutiva hypostasis.
        
It is therefore better to say that the persons or hypostases are distinguished rather by relations than by origin. For, although in both ways they are distinguished, nevertheless in our mode of understanding they are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations; whence this name "Father" signifies not only a property, but also the hypostasis; whereas this term "Begetter" or "Begetting" signifies property only; forasmuch as this name "Father" signifies the relation which is distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis; and this term "Begetter" or "Begotten" signifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis.

Ad secundum dicendum quod personae divinae non distinguuntur in esse in quo subsistunt, neque in aliquo absoluto, sed solum secundum id quod ad aliquid dicuntur. Unde ad earum distinctionem sufficit relatio.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The divine persons are not distinguished as regards being, in which they subsist, nor in anything absolute, but only as regards something relative. Hence relation suffices for their distinction.




Ad tertium dicendum quod quanto distinctio prior est, tanto propinquior est unitati. Et ideo debet esse minima. Et ideo distinctio personarum non debet esse nisi per id quod minimum distinguit, scilicet per relationem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The more prior a distinction is, the nearer it approaches to unity; and so it must be the least possible distinction. So the distinction of the persons must be by that which distinguishes the least possible; and this is by relation.




Ad quartum dicendum quod relatio praesupponit distinctionem suppositorum, quando est accidens, sed si relatio sit subsistens, non praesupponit, sed secum fert distinctionem.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod persona non addit supra hypostasim proprietatem distinguentem absolute, sed proprietatem distinguentem ad dignitatem pertinentem, totum enim hoc est accipiendum loco unius differentiae. Ad dignitatem autem pertinet proprietas distinguens, secundum quod intelligitur subsistens in natura rationali. Unde, remota proprietate distinguente a persona, non remanet hypostasis, sed remaneret, si tolleretur rationalitas naturae. Tam enim persona quam hypostasis est substantia individua, unde in divinis de ratione utriusque est relatio distinguens.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Person does not add to hypostasis a distinguishing property absolutely, but a distinguishing property of dignity, all of which must be taken as the difference. Now, this distinguishing property is one of dignity precisely because it is understood as subsisting in a rational nature. Hence, if the distinguishing property be removed from the person, the hypostasis no longer remains; whereas it would remain were the rationality of the nature removed; for both person and hypostasis are individual substances. Consequently, in God the distinguishing relation belongs essentially to both.




Ad secundum dicendum quod paternitate pater non solum est pater, sed est persona, et est quis sive hypostasis. Nec tamen sequitur quod filius non sit quis sive hypostasis; sicut non sequitur quod non sit persona.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 By paternity the Father is not only Father, but is a person, and is "someone," or a hypostasis. It does not follow, however, that the Son is not "someone" or a hypostasis; just as it does not follow that He is not a person.




Ad tertium dicendum quod intentio Augustini non fuit dicere quod hypostasis patris remaneat ingenita, remota paternitate, quasi innascibilitas constituat et distinguat hypostasim patris, hoc enim esse non potest, cum ingenitum nihil ponat, sed negative dicatur, ut ipsemet dicit. Sed loquitur in communi, quia non omne ingenitum est pater. Remota ergo paternitate, non remanet in divinis hypostasis patris, ut distinguitur ab aliis personis; sed ut distinguitur a creaturis, sicut Iudaei intelligunt.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Augustine does not mean to say that the hypostasis of the Father would remain as unbegotten, if His paternity were removed, as if innascibility constituted and distinguished the hypostasis of the Father; for this would be impossible, since "being unbegotten" says nothing positive and is only a negation, as he himself says. But he speaks in a general sense, forasmuch as not every unbegotten being is the Father. So, if paternity be removed, the hypostasis of the Father does not remain in God, as distinguished from the other persons, but only as distinguished from creatures; as the Jews understand it.

Ad secundum dicendum quod paternitate pater non solum est pater, sed est persona, et est quis sive hypostasis. Nec tamen sequitur quod filius non sit quis sive hypostasis; sicut non sequitur quod non sit persona.

Respondeo dicendum quod, secundum illos qui dicunt quod proprietates non distinguunt et constituunt hypostases, sed manifestant hypostases distinctas et constitutas, absolute dicendum est quod relationes, secundum modum intelligendi, consequuntur actus notionales; ut dici possit simpliciter quod quia generat, est pater. Sed supponendo quod relationes distinguant et constituant hypostases in divinis, oportet distinctione uti. Quia origo significatur in divinis active et passive, active quidem, sicut generatio attribuitur patri, et spiratio, sumpta pro actu notionali, attribuitur patri et filio; passive autem, sicut nativitas attribuitur filio, et processio spiritui sancto. Origines enim passive significatae, simpliciter praecedunt, secundum intellectum, proprietates personarum procedentium, etiam personales, quia origo passive significata, significatur ut via ad personam proprietate constitutam. Similiter et origo active significata, prior est, secundum intellectum, quam relatio personae originantis quae non est personalis, sicut actus notionalis spirationis, secundum intellectum, praecedit proprietatem relativam innominatam communem patri et filio. Sed proprietas personalis patris potest considerari dupliciter. Uno modo, ut est relatio, et sic iterum, secundum intellectum, praesupponit actum notionalem; quia relatio, inquantum huiusmodi, fundatur super actum. Alio modo, secundum quod est constitutiva personae, et sic oportet quod praeintelligatur relatio actui notionali, sicut persona agens praeintelligitur actioni.
        
I answer that,
 According to the opinion that the properties do not distinguish and constitute the hypostases in God, but only manifest them as already distinct and constituted, we must absolutely say that the relations in our mode of understanding follow upon the notional acts, so that we can say, without qualifying the phrase, that "because He begets, He is the Father." A distinction, however, is needed if we suppose that the relations distinguish and constitute the divine hypostases. For origin has in God an active and passive signification—active, as generation is attributed to the Father, and spiration, taken for the notional act, is attributed to the Father and the Son; passive, as nativity is attributed to the Son, and procession to the Holy Ghost. For, in the order of intelligence, origin, in the passive sense, simply precedes the personal properties of the person proceeding; because origin, as passively understood, signifies the way to a person constituted by the property. Likewise, origin signified actively is prior in the order of intelligence to the non-personal relation of the person originating; as the notional act of spiration precedes, in the order of intelligence, the unnamed relative property common to the Father and the Son. The personal property of the Father can be considered in a twofold sense: firstly, as a relation; and thus again in the order of intelligence it presupposes the notional act, for relation, as such, is founded upon an act: secondly, according as it constitutes the person; and thus the notional act presupposes the relation, as an action presupposes a person acting.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, cum Magister dicit quod quia generat est pater, accipit nomen patris secundum quod designat relationem tantum, non autem secundum quod significat personam subsistentem. Sic enim oporteret e converso dicere quod quia pater est, generat.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 When the Master says that "because He begets, He is Father," the term "Father" is taken as meaning relation only, but not as signifying the subsisting person; for then it would be necessary to say conversely that because He is Father He begets.




Ad secundum dicendum quod obiectio illa procedit de paternitate, secundum quod est relatio, et non secundum quod est constitutiva personae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This objection avails of paternity as a relation, but not as constituting a person.




Ad tertium dicendum quod nativitas est via ad personam filii, et ideo, secundum intellectum, praecedit filiationem, etiam secundum quod est constitutiva personae filii. Sed generatio activa significatur ut progrediens a persona patris, et ideo praesupponit proprietatem personalem patris.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Nativity is the way to the person of the Son; and so, in the order of intelligence, it precedes filiation, even as constituting the person of the Son. But active generation signifies a proceeding from the person of the Father; wherefore it presupposes the personal property of the Father.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, cum Magister dicit quod quia generat est pater, accipit nomen patris secundum quod designat relationem tantum, non autem secundum quod significat personam subsistentem. Sic enim oporteret e converso dicere quod quia pater est, generat.
