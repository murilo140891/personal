# Summa Theologica

Ad quartum dicendum quod, secundum Augustinum, informitas non praecedit formationem duratione. Unde oportet dicere quod per lucis productionem intelligatur formatio spiritualis creaturae non quae est per gloriam perfecta, cum qua creata non fuit; sed quae est per gratiam perfecta, cum qua creata fuit, ut dictum est. Per hanc ergo lucem facta est divisio a tenebris, idest ab informitate alterius creaturae non formatae. Vel, si tota creatura simul formata fuit, facta est distinctio a tenebris spiritualibus, non quae tunc essent (quia Diabolus non fuit creatus malus); sed quas Deus futuras praevidit.
        


Reply to Objection 4:
 As Augustine teaches (Confess. xii; Gen. ad lit. 1,15), formlessness did not precede forms in duration; and so we must understand the production of light to signify the formation of spiritual creatures, not, indeed, with the perfection of glory, in which they were not created, but with the perfection of grace, which they possessed from their creation as said above (

Article [3]
). Thus the division of light from darkness will denote the distinction of the spiritual creature from other created things as yet without form. But if all created things received their form at the same time, the darkness must be held to mean the spiritual darkness of the wicked, not as existing from the beginning but such as God foresaw would exist.
