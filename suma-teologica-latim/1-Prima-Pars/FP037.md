# Summa Theologica

Ad quartum dicendum quod, sicut filio, licet intelligat, non tamen sibi competit producere verbum, quia intelligere convenit ei ut verbo procedenti; ita, licet spiritus sanctus amet, essentialiter accipiendo, non tamen convenit ei quod spiret amorem, quod est diligere notionaliter sumptum; quia sic diligit essentialiter ut amor procedens, non ut a quo procedit amor.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 As it does not belong to the Son, though He understands, to produce a word, for it belongs to Him to understand as the word proceeding; so in like manner, although the Holy Ghost loves, taking Love as an essential term, still it does not belong to Him to spirate love, which is to take love as a notional term; because He loves essentially as love proceeding; but not as the one whence love proceeds.
