# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod, licet personae sint simplices, tamen absque praeiudicio simplicitatis possunt propriae rationes personarum in abstracto significari, ut dictum est/
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the persons are simple, still without prejudice to their simplicity, the proper ideas of the persons can be abstractedly signified, as above explained.

Sic igitur dicendum est quod circa notiones aliqui absque periculo haeresis contrarie sunt opinati, non intendentes sustinere aliquid contrarium fidei. Sed si quis falsum opinaretur circa notiones, considerans quod ex hoc sequatur aliquid contrarium fidei, in haeresim laberetur.
        
So we must decide that anyone may entertain contrary opinions about the notions, if he does not mean to uphold anything at variance with faith. If, however, anyone should entertain a false opinion of the notions, knowing or thinking that consequences against the faith would follow, he would lapse into heresy.




Et per hoc patet responsio ad obiecta.
