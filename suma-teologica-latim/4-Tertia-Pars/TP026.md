# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod spiritus sanctus, cum sit per omnia Deo aequalis, non potest dici medius vel mediator inter Deum et homines, sed solus Christus, qui, licet secundum divinitatem aequalis sit patri, tamen secundum humanitatem minor est patre, ut dictum est. Unde, super illud Galat. III, Christus est mediator, dicit Glossa, non pater vel spiritus sanctus. Dicitur autem spiritus sanctus interpellare pro nobis, quia ipse interpellare nos facit.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Since the Holy Ghost is in everything equal to God, He cannot be said to be between, or a Mediator of, God and men: but Christ alone, Who, though equal to the Father in His Godhead, yet is less than the Father in His human nature, as stated above (
Question [20]
, 
Article [1]
). Hence on Gal. 3:20, "Christ is a Mediator [Vulg.: 'Now a mediator is not of one, but God is one']," the gloss says: "Not the Father nor the Holy Ghost." The Holy Ghost, however, is said "to ask for us," because He makes us ask.
