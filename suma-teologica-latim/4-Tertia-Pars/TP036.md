# Summa Theologica

Respondeo dicendum quod nativitas Christi non debuit omnibus communiter esse manifesta. Primo quidem, quia per hoc impedita fuisset humana redemptio, quae per crucem eius peracta est, quia, ut dicitur I ad Cor. II, si cognovissent, nunquam dominum gloriae crucifixissent.
        


I answer that,
 It was unfitting that Christ's birth should be made known to all men without distinction. First, because this would have been a hindrance to the redemption of man, which was accomplished by means of the Cross; for, as it is written (
1 Cor. 2:8
): "If they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory."




Secundo, quia hoc diminuisset meritum fidei, per quam venerat homines iustificare, secundum illud Rom. III, iustitia Dei per fidem Iesu Christi. Si enim manifestis indiciis, Christo nascente, eius nativitas omnibus appareret, iam tolleretur ratio fidei, quae est argumentum non apparentium, ut dicitur Heb. XI.
        
Secondly, because this would have lessened the merit of faith, which He came to offer men as the way to righteousness. according to Rm. 3:22: "The justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ." For if, when Christ was born, His birth had been made known to all by evident signs, the very nature of faith would have been destroyed, since it is "the evidence of things that appear not," as stated, Heb. 11:1.




Tertio, quia per hoc venisset in dubium veritas humanitatis ipsius. Unde Augustinus dicit, in epistola ad Volusianum, si nullas ex parvulo in iuventutem mutaret aetates, nullos cibos, nullos caperet somnos, nonne opinionem confirmaret erroris, nec hominem verum ullo modo suscepisse crederetur, et, dum omnia mirabiliter facit, auferret quod misericorditer fecit?
        
Thirdly, because thus the reality of His human nature would have come into doubt. Whence Augustine says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): "If He had not passed through the different stages of age from babyhood to youth, had neither eaten nor slept, would He not have strengthened an erroneous opinion, and made it impossible for us to believe that He had become true man? And while He is doing all things wondrously, would He have taken away that which He accomplished in mercy?"
      


Ad primum ergo dicendum quod auctoritas illa intelligitur de adventu Christi ad iudicium, secundum quod Glossa ibidem exponit.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 According to the gloss, the words quoted must be understood of Christ's coming as judge.




Ad secundum dicendum quod de gratia Dei salvatoris erudiendi erant omnes homines ad salutem, non in principio nativitatis eius, sed postea, tempore procedente, postquam operatus esset salutem in medio terrae. Unde, post passionem et resurrectionem suam, dixit discipulis, Matth. ult., euntes, docete omnes gentes.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 All men were to be instructed unto salvation, concerning the grace of God our Saviour, not at the very time of His birth, but afterwards, in due time, after He had "wrought salvation in the midst of the earth" (
Ps. 73:12
). Wherefore after His Passion and Resurrection, He said to His disciples (
Mt. 28:19
): "Going... teach ye all nations."




Ad tertium dicendum quod ad iudicium requiritur quod auctoritas iudicis cognoscatur, et propter hoc oportet quod adventus Christi ad iudicium sit manifestus. Sed primus adventus fuit ad omnium salutem, quae est per fidem, quae quidem est de non apparentibus. Et ideo adventus Christi primus debuit esse occultus.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 For judgment to be passed, the authority of the judge needs to be known: and for this reason it behooves that the coming of Christ unto judgment should be manifest. But His first coming was unto the salvation of all, which is by faith that is of things not seen. And therefore it was fitting that His first coming should be hidden.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod caelum in sacra Scriptura quandoque dicitur aer, secundum illud, volucres caeli et pisces maris.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 In Holy Scripture the air is sometimes called the heavens---for instance, "The birds of the heavens [Douay: 'air'] and the fishes of the sea."




Ad secundum dicendum quod ipsi caelestes Angeli ex suo officio habent ut ad nos descendant, in ministerium missi. Sed stellae caelestes suum situm non mutant. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The angels of heaven, by reason of their very office, come down to us, being "sent to minister." But the stars of heaven do not change their position. Wherefore there is no comparison.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut stella non est secuta motum stellarum caelestium, ita nec stellarum comatarum, quae nec de die apparent, nec cursum suum ordinatum mutant. Et tamen non omnino aberat significatio cometarum. Quia caeleste regnum Christi comminuit et consumpsit universa regna terrae, et ipsum stabit in aeternum, ut dicitur Dan. II.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 As the star did not follow the course of the heavenly stars, so neither did it follow the course of the comets, which neither appear during the daytime nor vary their customary course. Nevertheless in its signification it has something in common with the comets. Because the heavenly kingdom of Christ "shall break in pieces, and shall consume all the kingdoms" of the earth, "and itself shall stand for ever" (
Dan. 2:44
).
