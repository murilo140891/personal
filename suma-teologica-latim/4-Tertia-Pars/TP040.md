# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod in eo qui ex necessitate pauper est, humilitas non multum commendatur. Sed in eo qui voluntarie pauper est, sicut fuit Christus, ipsa paupertas est maximae humilitatis indicium.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Humility is not much to be praised in one who is poor of necessity. But in one who, like Christ, is poor willingly, poverty itself is a sign of very great humility.
