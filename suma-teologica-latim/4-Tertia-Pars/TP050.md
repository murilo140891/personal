# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus est fons vitae secundum quod Deus, non autem secundum quod homo. Mortuus autem est non secundum quod Deus, sed secundum quod homo. Unde Augustinus dicit, contra Felicianum, absit ut Christus sic senserit mortem ut, quantum est in se vita, vitam perdiderit. Si enim hoc ita esset, vitae fons aruisset. Sensit igitur mortem participatione humani affectus, quem sponte susceperat, non naturae suae perdidit potentiam, per quam cuncta vivificat.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Christ is the fountain of life, as God, and not as man: but He died as man, and not as God. Hence Augustine [*Vigilius Tapsensis] says against Felician: "Far be it from us to suppose that Christ so felt death that He lost His life inasmuch as He is life in Himself; for, were it so, the fountain of life would have run dry. Accordingly, He experienced death by sharing in our human feeling, which of His own accord He had taken upon Himself, but He did not lose the power of His Nature, through which He gives life to all things."




Ad secundum dicendum quod Christus non sustinuit mortem ex morbo provenientem, ne videretur ex necessitate mori propter infirmitatem naturae. Sed sustinuit mortem ab exteriori illatam, cui se spontaneum obtulit, ut mors eius voluntaria ostenderetur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ did not suffer death which comes of sickness, lest He should seem to die of necessity from exhausted nature: but He endured death inflicted from without, to which He willingly surrendered Himself, that His death might be shown to be a voluntary one.




Ad tertium dicendum quod unum oppositorum per se non ducit ad aliud, sed quandoque per accidens, sicut frigidum quandoque per accidens calefacit. Et hoc modo Christus per suam mortem nos perduxit ad vitam, quia de sua morte mortem nostram destruxit, sicut ille qui poenam pro alio sustinet, removet poenam eius.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 One opposite does not of itself lead to the other, yet it does so indirectly at times: thus cold sometimes is the indirect cause of heat: and in this way Christ by His death brought us back to life, when by His death He destroyed our death; just as he who bears another's punishment takes such punishment away.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod derelictio illa non est referenda ad solutionem unionis personalis, sed ad hoc quod Deus pater eum exposuit passioni. Unde derelinquere ibi non est aliud quam non protegere a persequentibus. Vel dicit se derelictum quantum ad illam orationem qua dixerat, pater, si fieri potest, transeat a me calix iste, ut Augustinus exponit, in libro de gratia novi testamenti.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Such forsaking is not to be referred to the dissolving of the personal union, but to this, that God the Father gave Him up to the Passion: hence there "to forsake" means simply not to protect from persecutors. or else He says there that He is forsaken, with reference to the prayer He had made: "Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass away from Me," as Augustine explains it (De Gratia Novi Test.).




Ad secundum dicendum quod verbum Dei dicitur esse unitum carni mediante anima, inquantum caro per animam pertinet ad humanam naturam, quam filius Dei assumere intendebat, non autem ita quod anima sit quasi medium ligans unita. Habet autem caro ab anima quod pertineat ad humanam naturam, etiam postquam anima separatur ab ea, inquantum scilicet in carne mortua remanet, ex divina ordinatione, quidam ordo ad resurrectionem. Et ideo non tollitur unio divinitatis ad carnem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The Word of God is said to be united with the flesh through the medium of the soul, inasmuch as it is through the soul that the flesh belongs to human nature, which the Son of God intended to assume; but not as though the soul were the medium linking them together. But it is due to the soul that the flesh is human even after the soul has been separated from it---namely, inasmuch as by God's ordinance there remains in the dead flesh a certain relation to the resurrection. And therefore the union of the Godhead with the flesh is not taken away.




Ad tertium dicendum quod anima habet vim vivificandi formaliter. Et ideo, ea praesente et unita formaliter, necesse est corpus esse vivum. Divinitas autem non habet vim vivificandi formaliter, sed effective, non enim potest esse corporis forma. Et ideo non est necesse quod, manente unione divinitatis ad carnem, caro sit viva, quia Deus non ex necessitate agit, sed ex voluntate.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The soul formally possesses the life-giving energy, and therefore, while it is present, and united formally, the body must necessarily be a living one, whereas the Godhead has not the life-giving energy formally, but effectively; because It cannot be the form of the body: and therefore it is not necessary for the flesh to be living while the union of the Godhead with the flesh remains, since God does not act of necessity, but of His own will.

Ad quartum dicendum quod, sicut Damascenus dicit, in III libro, quod in morte Christi est separata anima a carne, non est una hypostasis in duas hypostases divisa. Et corpus enim et anima secundum idem ex principio in verbi hypostasi habuerunt existentiam, et in morte, invicem divisa, singula eorum manserunt unam hypostasim verbi habens. Quare una verbi hypostasis verbi et animae et corporis exstitit hypostasis. Nunquam enim neque anima neque corpus propriam habuerunt hypostasim, praeter verbi hypostasim. Una enim semper verbi hypostasis, et nunquam duae.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "In Christ's death the soul was separated from the flesh: not one hypostasis divided into two: because both soul and body in the same respect had their existence from the beginning in the hypostasis of the Word; and in death, though severed from one another, each one continued to have the one same hypostasis of the Word. Wherefore the one hypostasis of the Word was the hypostasis of the Word, of the soul, and of the body. For neither soul nor body ever had an hypostasis of its own, besides the hypostasis of the Word: for there was always one hypostasis of the Word, and never two."

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod verbum Dei suscepit animam et carnem unitam, et ideo illa susceptio fecit Deum hominem et hominem Deum. Non autem cessavit illa susceptio per separationem verbi ab anima vel a carne, cessavit tamen unio carnis et animae.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The Word of God assumed a united soul and body: and the result of this assumption was that God is man, and man is God. But this assumption did not cease by the separation of the Word from the soul or from the flesh; yet the union of soul and flesh ceased.




Ad secundum dicendum quod homo dicitur esse suus intellectus, non quia intellectus sit totus homo, sed quia intellectus est principalior pars hominis, in quo virtualiter existit tota dispositio hominis, sicut si rector civitatis dicatur tota civitas, quia in eo consistit tota dispositio civitatis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Man is said to be his own intellect, not because the intellect is the entire man, but because the intellect is the chief part of man, in which man's whole disposition lies virtually; just as the ruler of the city may be called the whole city, since its entire disposal is vested in him.




Ad tertium dicendum quod esse sacerdotem convenit homini ratione animae, in qua est ordinis character. Unde per mortem homo non perdit ordinem sacerdotalem. Et multo minus Christus, qui est totius sacerdotii origo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 That a man is competent to be a priest is by reason of the soul, which is the subject of the character of order: hence a man does not lose his priestly order by death, and much less does Christ, who is the fount of the entire priesthood.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod mors Christi est operata salutem nostram ex virtute divinitatis unitae, et non ex sola ratione mortis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Christ's death wrought our salvation from the power of the Godhead united, and not consisted merely as His death.




Ad secundum dicendum quod mors Christi, secundum quod consideratur in facto esse, etsi non fuerit ad nostram salutem operata per modum meriti, fuit tamen operata per modum efficientiae, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Though Christ's death, considered "in fact" did not effect our salvation by way of merit, yet it did so by way of causality, as stated above.




Ad tertium dicendum quod mors Christi fuit quidem corporalis, sed corpus illud fuit instrumentum divinitatis sibi unitae, operans in virtute eius etiam mortuum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ's death was indeed corporeal; but the body was the instrument of the Godhead united to Him, working by Its power, although dead.
