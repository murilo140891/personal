# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod, cum ens non sit genus, hoc ipsum quod est esse, non potest esse essentia vel substantiae vel accidentis. Non ergo definitio substantiae est ens per se sine subiecto, nec definitio accidentis ens in subiecto sed quidditati seu essentiae substantiae competit habere esse non in subiecto; quidditati autem sive essentiae accidentis competit habere esse in subiecto. In hoc autem sacramento non datur accidentibus quod ex vi suae essentiae sint sine subiecto, sed ex divina virtute sustentante. Et ideo non desinunt esse accidentia, quia nec separatur ab eis definitio accidentis, nec competit eis definitio substantiae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Since being is not a genus, then being cannot be of itself the essence of either substance or accident. Consequently, the definition of substance is not---"a being of itself without a subject," nor is the definition of accident---"a being in a subject"; but it belongs to the quiddity or essence of substance "to have existence not in a subject"; while it belongs to the quiddity or essence of accident "to have existence in a subject." But in this sacrament it is not in virtue of their essence that accidents are not in a subject, but through the Divine power sustaining them; and consequently they do not cease to be accidents, because neither is the definition of accident withdrawn from them, nor does the definition of substance apply to them.




Ad tertium dicendum quod huiusmodi accidentia acquisierunt esse individuum in substantia panis et vini, qua conversa in corpus et sanguinem Christi, remanent virtute divina accidentia in illo esse individuato quod prius habebant. Unde sunt singularia et sensibilia.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 These accidents acquired individual being in the substance of the bread and wine; and when this substance is changed into the body and blood of Christ, they remain in that individuated being which they possessed before, hence they are individual and sensible.




Ad quartum dicendum quod accidentia huiusmodi, manente substantia panis et vini, non habebant ipsa esse nec alia accidentia, sed substantia eorum habebat huiusmodi esse per ea; sicut nix est alba per albedinem. Sed post consecrationem ipsa accidentia quae remanent, habent esse. Unde sunt composita ex esse et quod est, sicut in prima parte de Angelis dictum est. Et cum hoc, habent compositionem partium quantitativarum.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 These accidents had no being of their own nor other accidents, so long as the substance of the bread and wine remained; but their subjects had "such" being through them, just as snow is "white" through whiteness. But after the consecration the accidents which remain have being; hence they are compounded of existence and essence, as was said of the angels, in the FP, Question [50], Article [2], ad 3; and besides they have composition of quantitative parts.

Ad quartum dicendum quod quantitas mathematica non abstrahit a materia intelligibili, sed a materia sensibili, ut dicitur VII Metaphys. Dicitur autem materia sensibilis ex hoc quod subiicitur sensibilibus qualitatibus. Et ideo manifestum est quod quantitas dimensiva quae remanet in hoc sacramento sine subiecto, non est quantitas mathematica.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Mathematical quantity abstracts not from intelligible matter, but from sensible matter, as is said in Metaph. vii. But matter is termed sensible because it underlies sensible qualities. And therefore it is manifest that the dimensive quantity, which remains in this sacrament without a subject, is not mathematical quantity.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod species sacramentales, licet sint formae sine materia existentes, retinent tamen idem esse quod habebant prius in materia. Et ideo secundum suum esse assimilantur formis quae sunt in materia.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The sacramental species, although they are forms existing without matter, still retain the same being which they had before in matter, and therefore as to their being they are like forms which are in matter.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ita actio formae accidentalis dependet ab actione formae substantialis, sicut esse accidentis dependet ab esse substantiae. Et ideo, sicut divina virtute datur speciebus sacramentalibus ut possint esse sine substantia, ita datur eis ut possint agere sine forma substantiali, virtute Dei, a quo sicut a primo agente dependet omnis actio formae et substantialis et accidentalis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The action of an accidental form depends upon the action of a substantial form in the same way as the being of accident depends upon the being of substance; and therefore, as it is an effect of Divine power that the sacramental species exist without substance, so is it an effect of Divine power that they can act without a substantial form, because every action of a substantial or accidental form depends upon God as the first agent.




Ad tertium dicendum quod immutatio quae est ad formam substantialem, non fit a forma substantiali immediate, sed mediantibus qualitatibus activis et passivis, quae agunt in virtute formae substantialis. Haec autem virtus instrumentalis conservatur in speciebus sacramentalibus divina virtute sicut et prius erat. Et ideo possunt agere ad formam substantialem instrumentaliter, per quem modum aliquid potest agere ultra suam speciem, non quasi virtute propria, sed virtute principalis agentis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The change which terminates in a substantial form is not effected by a substantial form directly, but by means of the active and passive qualities, which act in virtue of the substantial form. But by Divine power this instrumental energy is retained in the sacramental species, just as it was before: and consequently their action can be directed to a substantial form instrumentally, just in the same way as anything can act outside its species, not as by its own power, but by the power of the chief agent.

Similiter etiam non potest stare quod quidam dicunt, quod species sacramentales nutriunt per formam substantialem panis et vini, quae remanet. Tum quia non remanet, ut supra habitum est. Tum quia non est actus formae nutrire, sed magis materiae, quae accipit formam nutriti, recedente forma nutrimenti. Unde dicitur in II de anima, quod nutrimentum in principio est dissimile, in fine autem simile.
        

          In like manner the statement advanced by others cannot stand, who hold that the sacramental species nourish owing to the remaining substantial form of the bread and wine: both because the form does not remain, as stated above (
Question [75]
, 
Article [6]
): and because to nourish is the act not of a form but rather of matter, which takes the form of the one nourished, while the form of the nourishment passes away: hence it is said in De Anima ii that nourishment is at first unlike, but at the end is like.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, facta consecratione, dupliciter potest dici panis in hoc sacramento. Uno modo, ipsae species panis, quae retinent nomen prioris substantiae, ut Gregorius dicit, in homilia paschali. Alio modo, potest dici panis ipsum corpus Christi, quod est panis mysticus de caelo descendens. Ambrosius ergo, cum dicit quod iste panis non transit in corpus, accipit panem secundo modo, quia scilicet corpus Christi non convertitur in corpus hominis, sed reficit mentem eius. Non autem loquitur de pane primo modo dicto.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 After the consecration bread can be said to be in this sacrament in two ways. First, as to the species, which retain the name of the previous substance, as Gregory says in an Easter Homily (Lanfranc, De Corp. et Sang. Dom. xx). Secondly, Christ's very body can be called bread, since it is the mystical bread "coming down from heaven." Consequently, Ambrose uses the word "bread" in this second meaning, when he says that "this bread does not pass into the body," because, to wit, Christ's body is not changed into man's body, but nourishes his soul. But he is not speaking of bread taken in the first acceptation.




Ad secundum dicendum quod species sacramentales, etsi non sint ea ex quibus corpus hominis constat, tamen in ea convertuntur, sicut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although the sacramental species are not those things out of which the human body is made, yet they are changed into those things stated above.




Ad tertium dicendum quod species sacramentales, quamvis non sint substantia, habent tamen virtutem substantiae, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the sacramental species are not a substance, still they have the virtue of a substance, as stated above.
