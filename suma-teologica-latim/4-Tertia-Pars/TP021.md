# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod unio in persona est secundum esse personale, quod pertinet ad quamlibet partem humanae naturae. Sed ascensio orationis est per actum qui non convenit nisi rationi, ut dictum est. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The union in person is according to the personal being, which pertains to every part of the human nature; but the uplifting of prayer is by an act which pertains only to the reason, as stated above. Hence there is no parity.

Ad tertium dicendum quod ipsa gloria quam Christus orando sibi petebat, pertinebat ad salutem aliorum, secundum illud Rom. IV, resurrexit propter iustificationem nostram. Et ideo illa etiam oratio quam pro se faciebat, erat quodammodo pro aliis. Sicut et quicumque homo aliquod bonum a Deo postulat ut utatur illo ad utilitatem aliorum, non sibi soli, sed etiam aliis orat.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This very glory which Christ, while praying, besought for Himself, pertained to the salvation of others according to Rm. 4:25: "He rose again for our justification." Consequently the prayer which He offered for Himself was also in a manner offered for others. So also anyone that asks a boon of God that he may use it for the good of others, prays not only for himself, but also for others.

Ad secundum dicendum quod dominus non oravit pro omnibus crucifixoribus, neque etiam pro omnibus qui erant credituri in eum, sed pro his solum qui erant praedestinati ut per ipsum vitam consequerentur aeternam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Our Lord did not pray for all those who crucified Him, as neither did He for all those who would believe in Him; but for those only who were predestinated to obtain eternal life through Him.




Unde patet etiam responsio ad tertium.
        
Wherefore the reply to the third objection is also manifest.
      


Ad quartum dicendum quod, cum dicit, clamabo et non exaudies, intelligendum est quantum ad affectum sensualitatis, quae mortem refugiebat. Exauditur tamen quantum ad affectum rationis, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 When He says: "I shall cry and Thou wilt not hear," we must take this as referring to the desire of sensuality, which shunned death. But He is heard as to the desire of His reason, as stated above.
