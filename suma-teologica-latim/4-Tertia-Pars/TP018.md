# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod ipsa potentia voluntatis est naturalis, et consequitur naturam ex necessitate. Sed motus vel actus potentiae, qui etiam voluntas dicitur, quandoque quidem est naturalis et necessarius, puta respectu felicitatis; quandoque autem ex libero arbitrio rationis proveniens, et non necessarius neque naturalis; sicut patet ex his quae in secunda parte dicta sunt. Et tamen etiam ipsa ratio, quae est principium huius motus, est naturalis. Et ideo, praeter voluntatem divinam, oportet in Christo ponere voluntatem humanam, non solum prout est potentia naturalis, aut prout est motus naturalis, sed etiam prout est motus rationalis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The power of the will is natural, and necessarily follows upon the nature; but the movement or act of this power---which is also called will---is sometimes natural and necessary, e.g. with respect to beatitude; and sometimes springs from free-will and is neither necessary nor natural, as is plain from what has been stated in the FS, Question [10], Articles [1],[2] [*Cf. FP, Question [82], Article [2]]. And yet even reason itself, which is the principle of this movement, is natural. Hence besides the Divine will it is necessary to place in Christ a human will, not merely as a natural power, or a natural movement, but even as a rational movement.




Ad quartum dicendum quod per hoc quod dicitur aliqualiter velle, designatur determinatus modus volendi. Determinatus autem modus ponitur circa ipsam rem cuius est modus. Unde, cum voluntas pertineat ad naturam, ipsum etiam quod est aliqualiter velle, pertinet ad naturam, non secundum quod est absolute considerata, sed secundum quod est in tali hypostasi. Unde etiam voluntas humana Christi habuit quendam determinatum modum ex eo quod fuit in hypostasi divina, ut scilicet moveretur semper secundum nutum divinae voluntatis.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 When we say "to will in a certain way," we signify a determinate mode of willing. Now a determinate mode regards the thing of which it is the mode. Hence since the will pertains to the nature, "to will in a certain way" belongs to the nature, not indeed considered absolutely, but as it is in the hypostasis. Hence the human will of Christ had a determinate mode from the fact of being in a Divine hypostasis, i.e. it was always moved in accordance with the bidding of the Divine will.

Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, filius Dei humanam naturam assumpsit cum omnibus quae pertinent ad perfectionem ipsius naturae. In humana autem natura includitur etiam natura animalis, sicut in specie includitur genus. Unde oportet quod filius Dei cum humana natura assumpserit etiam ea quae pertinent ad perfectionem naturae animalis. Inter quae est appetitus sensitivus, qui sensualitas dicitur. Et ideo oportet dicere quod in Christo fuit sensualis appetitus, sive sensualitas. Sciendum est autem quod sensualitas, sive sensualis appetitus, inquantum est natus obedire rationi, dicitur rationale per participationem, ut patet per philosophum, in I Ethic. Et quia voluntas est in ratione, ut dictum est, pari ratione potest dici quod sensualitas sit voluntas per participationem.
        


I answer that,
 As was said (
Question [9]
, 
Article [1]
), the Son of God assumed human nature together with everything pertaining to the perfection of human nature. Now in human nature is included animal nature, as the genus in its species. Hence the Son of God must have assumed together with the human nature whatever belongs to animal nature; one of which things is the sensitive appetite, which is called the sensuality. Consequently it must be allowed that in Christ there was a sensual appetite, or sensuality. But it must be borne in mind that sensuality or the sensual appetite, inasmuch as it naturally obeys reason, is said to be "rational by participation," as is clear from the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 13). And because "the will is in the reason," as stated above, it may equally be said that the sensuality is "a will by participation."




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de voluntate essentialiter dicta, quae non est nisi in parte intellectiva. Sed voluntas participative dicta potest esse in parte sensitiva, inquantum obedit rationi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument is based on the will, essentially so called, which is only in the intellectual part; but the will by participation can be in the sensitive part, inasmuch as it obeys reason.
      


Ad secundum dicendum quod sensualitas significatur per serpentem, non quantum ad naturam sensualitatis, quam Christus assumpsit, sed quantum ad corruptionem fomitis, quae in Christo non fuit.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The sensuality is signified by the serpent---not as regards the nature of the sensuality, which Christ assumed, but as regards the corruption of the "fomes," which was not in Christ.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, ubi est unum propter alterum, ibi tantum unum esse videtur, sicut superficies, quae est visibilis per colorem, est unum visibile cum colore. Et similiter, quia sensualitas non dicitur voluntas nisi quia participat voluntatem rationis, sicut est una natura humana in Christo, ita etiam ponitur una voluntas humana in Christo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 "Where there is one thing on account of another, there seems to be only one" (Aristotle, Topic. iii); thus a surface which is visible by color is one visible thing with the color. So, too, because the sensuality is called the will, only because it partakes of the rational will, there is said to be but one human will in Christ, even as there is but one human nature.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod illae voluntates non diversificantur secundum potentiam, sed solum secundum differentiam actus, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 These two wills do not diversify the power but only the act, as we have said.




Ad secundum dicendum quod etiam intellectus et ratio non sunt diversae potentiae, ut in prima parte dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The intellect and the reason are not distinct powers, as was said in the FP, Question [79], Article [8].




Ad tertium dicendum quod voluntas pietatis non videtur esse aliud quam voluntas quae consideratur ut natura, inquantum scilicet refugit alienum malum absolute consideratum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The "will of piety" would not seem to be distinct from the will considered as nature, inasmuch as it shrinks from another's evil, absolutely considered.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus volebat ut voluntas patris impleretur, non autem secundum voluntatem sensualitatis cuius motus non se extendit usque ad voluntatem Dei; neque per voluntatem quae consideratur per modum naturae, quae fertur in aliqua obiecta absolute considerata, et non in ordine ad divinam voluntatem.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 By His rational will Christ willed the Divine will to be fulfilled; but not by His will of sensuality, the movement of which does not extend to the will of God---nor by His will considered as nature which regards things absolutely considered and not in relation to the Divine will.




Ad secundum dicendum quod conformitas voluntatis humanae ad voluntatem divinam attenditur secundum voluntatem rationis, secundum quam etiam voluntates amicorum concordant, inquantum scilicet ratio considerat aliquod volitum in ordine ad voluntatem amici.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The conformity of the human will to the Divine regards the will of reason: according to which the wills even of friends agree, inasmuch as reason considers something willed in its relation to the will of a friend.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus simul fuit comprehensor et viator, inquantum scilicet per mentem fruebatur Deo, et habebat carnem passibilem. Et ideo ex parte carnis passibilis poterat in eo aliquid accidere quod repugnaret naturali voluntati ipsius, et etiam appetitui sensitivo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ was at once comprehensor and wayfarer, inasmuch as He was enjoying God in His mind and had a passible body. Hence things repugnant to His natural will and to His sensitive appetite could happen to Him in His passible flesh.
