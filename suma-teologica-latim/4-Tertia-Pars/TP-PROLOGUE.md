# Summa Theologica

Circa quam,
          


primo considerandum occurrit de ipso salvatore;
            
secundo, de sacramentis eius, quibus salutem consequimur;
            
tertio, de fine immortalis vitae, ad quem per ipsum resurgendo pervenimus.
          



          Concerning this we must consider
          


(1) the Saviour Himself;
            
(2) the sacraments by which we attain to our salvation;
            
(3) the end of immortal life to which we attain by the resurrection.







          Circa primum duplex consideratio occurrit,
          


prima est de ipso incarnationis mysterio, secundum quod Deus pro nostra salute factus est homo;
            
secunda de his quae per ipsum salvatorem nostrum, idest Deum incarnatum, sunt acta et passa.
          



          Concerning the first, a double consideration occurs:
          


the first, about the mystery of the Incarnation itself, whereby God was made man for our salvation;
            
the second, about such things as were done and suffered by our Saviour---i.e. God incarnate.
