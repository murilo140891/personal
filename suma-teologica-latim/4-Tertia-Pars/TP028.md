# Summa Theologica

Ad quartum dicendum quod ratio illa habet locum in his quae procedunt in esse per viam naturae, eo quod natura, sicut est determinata ad unum effectum, ita est etiam determinata ad unum modum producendi illum. Sed cum virtus supernaturalis divina possit in infinita, sicut non est determinata ad unum effectum, ita non est determinata ad modum producendi quemcumque effectum. Et ideo, sicut virtute divina fieri potuit ut primus homo de limo terrae formaretur, ita etiam fieri potuit ut divina virtute corpus Christi formaretur de virgine absque virili semine.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 This argument is true of those things which come into existence by the way of nature: since nature, just as it is fixed to one particular effect, so it is determinate to one mode of producing that effect. But as the supernatural power of God extends to the infinite: just as it is not determinate to one effect, so neither is it determinate to one mode of producing any effect whatever. Consequently, just as it was possible for the first man to be produced, by the Divine power, "from the slime of the earth," so too was it possible for Christ's body to be made, by Divine power, from a virgin without the seed of the male.




Ad quintum dicendum quod, secundum philosophum, in libro de Generat. Animal., semen maris non est sicut materia in conceptione animalis, sed solum sicut agens, sola autem femina materiam subministrat in conceptu. Unde per hoc quod semen maris defuit in conceptione corporis Christi, non sequitur quod defuerit ei debita materia.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 According to the Philosopher (De Gener. Animal. i, ii, iv), in conception the seed of the male is not by way of matter, but by way of agent: and the female alone supplies the matter. Wherefore though the seed of the male was lacking in Christ's conception, it does not follow that due matter was lacking.




Si tamen semen maris esset materia fetus concepti in animalibus, manifestum tamen est quod non est materia permanens in eadem forma, sed materia transmutata. Et quamvis virtus naturalis non possit transmutare ad certam formam nisi determinatam materiam, virtus tamen divina, quae est infinita, potest transmutare omnem materiam in quamcumque formam. Unde, sicut transmutavit limum terrae in corpus Adae, ita in corpus Christi transmutare potuit materiam a matre ministratam, etiam si non esset sufficiens materia ad naturalem conceptum.
        
But if the seed of the male were the matter of the fetus in animal conception, it is nevertheless manifest that it is not a matter remaining under one form, but subject to transformation. And though the natural power cannot transmute other than determinate matter to a determinate form; nevertheless the Divine power, which is infinite, can transmute all matter to any form whatsoever. Consequently, just as it transmuted the slime of the earth into Adam's body, so could it transmute the matter supplied by His Mother into Christ's body, even though it were not the sufficient matter for a natural conception.

Ad sextum dicendum quod Maria quae dicitur Iacobi et Ioseph mater, non intelligitur esse mater domini, quae in Evangelio non consuevit nominari nisi cum cognominatione huius dignitatis, quod sit mater Iesu. Haec autem Maria intelligitur esse uxor Alphaei, cuius filius est Iacobus minor, qui dictus est frater domini.
        


Reply to Objection 6:
 Mary who is called "the mother of James and Joseph" is not to be taken for the Mother of our Lord, who is not wont to be named in the Gospels save under this designation of her dignity---"the Mother of Jesus." This Mary is to be taken for the wife of Alphaeus, whose son was James the less, known as the "brother of the Lord" (
Gal. 1:19
).

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, quia videbatur esse lege prohibitum non dare operam ad relinquendum semen super terram, ideo non simpliciter virginitatem vovit Dei genitrix, sed sub conditione, si Deo placeret. Postquam autem ei innotuit hoc esse Deo acceptum, absolute vovit, antequam ab Angelo annuntiaretur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Because it seemed to be forbidden by the law not to take the necessary steps for leaving a posterity on earth, therefore the Mother of God did not vow virginity absolutely, but under the condition that it were pleasing to God. When, however, she knew that it was acceptable to God, she made the vow absolute, before the angel's Annunciation.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut gratiae plenitudo perfecte quidem fuit in Christo, et tamen aliqua eius inchoatio praecessit in matre; ita etiam observatio consiliorum, quae per gratiam Dei fit, perfecte quidem incoepit in Christo, sed aliquo modo fuit inchoata in virgine matre eius.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Just as the fulness of grace was in Christ perfectly, yet some beginning of the fulness preceded in His Mother; so also the observance of the counsels, which is an effect of God's grace, began its perfection in Christ, but was begun after a fashion in His Virgin Mother.




Ad tertium dicendum quod verbum illud apostoli est intelligendum de illis qui absolute castitatem vovent. Quod quidem mater Dei non fecit antequam Ioseph desponsaretur. Sed post desponsationem, ex communi voluntate, simul cum sponso suo votum virginitatis emisit.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 These words of the Apostle are to be understood of those who vow chastity absolutely. Christ's Mother did not do this until she was espoused to Joseph. After her espousals, however, by their common consent she took a vow of virginity together with her spouse.
