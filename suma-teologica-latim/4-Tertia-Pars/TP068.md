# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod illi qui sunt sanctificati in utero, consequuntur quidem gratiam emundantem a peccato originali, non tamen ex hoc ipso consequuntur characterem, quo Christo configurentur. Et propter hoc, si aliqui nunc sanctificarentur in utero, necesse esset eos baptizari, ut per susceptionem characteris aliis membris Christi conformarentur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Those who are sanctified in the womb, receive indeed grace which cleanses them from original sin, but they do not therefore receive the character, by which they are conformed to Christ. Consequently, if any were to be sanctified in the womb now, they would need to be baptized, in order to be conformed to Christ's other members by receiving the character.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod illud verbum est intelligendum de peccatoribus qui habent voluntatem recedendi a peccato.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The words quoted are to be understood of those sinners whose will is set on renouncing sin.




Ad secundum dicendum quod spiritualis medicus, scilicet Christus, dupliciter operatur. Uno modo, interius per seipsum, et sic praeparat voluntatem hominis ut bonum velit et malum odiat. Alio modo operatur per ministros, exterius adhibendo sacramenta, et sic operatur perficiendo id quod est exterius inchoatum. Et ideo sacramentum Baptismi non est exhibendum nisi ei in quo interioris conversionis aliquod signum apparet, sicut nec medicina corporalis adhibetur infirmo nisi in eo aliquis motus vitalis appareat.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The physician of souls, i.e. Christ, works in two ways. First, inwardly, by Himself: and thus He prepares man's will so that it wills good and hates evil. Secondly, He works through ministers, by the outward application of the sacraments: and in this way His work consists in perfecting what was begun outwardly. Therefore the sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred save on those in whom there appears some sign of their interior conversion: just as neither is bodily medicine given to a sick man, unless he show some sign of life.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismus est fidei sacramentum. Fides autem informis non sufficit ad salutem, nec ipsa est fundamentum, sed sola fides formata, quae per dilectionem operatur, ut Augustinus dicit, in libro de fide et operibus. Unde nec sacramentum Baptismi salutem conferre potest cum voluntate peccandi, quae fidei formam excludit. Non autem est per impressionem characteris baptismalis aliquis disponendus ad gratiam, quandiu apparet in eo voluntas peccandi, quia, Deus neminem ad virtutem compellit, sicut Damascenus dicit.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Baptism is the sacrament of faith. Now dead faith does not suffice for salvation; nor is it the foundation, but living faith alone, "that worketh by charity" (
Gal. 5:6
), as Augustine says (De Fide et oper.). Neither, therefore, can the sacrament of Baptism give salvation to a man whose will is set on sinning, and hence expels the form of faith. Moreover, the impression of the baptismal character cannot dispose a man for grace as long as he retains the will to sin; for "God compels no man to be virtuous," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii).

Ad tertium dicendum quod confessio est pars poenitentiae sacramentalis, quae non requiritur ante Baptismum, ut dictum est, sed requiritur interioris poenitentiae virtus.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Confession is a part of sacramental Penance, which is not required before Baptism, as stated above: but the inward virtue of Penance is required.

Ad secundum dicendum quod, si in adulto deesset intentio suscipiendi sacramentum, esset rebaptizandus. Si tamen hoc non constaret, esset dicendum, si non es baptizatus, ego te baptizo.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 If an adult lack the intention of receiving the sacrament, he must be rebaptized. But if there be doubt about this, the form to be used should be: "If thou art not baptized, I baptize thee."




Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismus ordinatur non solum contra originale peccatum, sed etiam contra actualia, quae per voluntatem et intentionem causantur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Baptism is a remedy not only against original, but also against actual sins, which are caused by our will and intention.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod regeneratio spiritualis, quae fit per Baptismum, quodammodo similis est nativitati carnali, quantum ad hoc quod, sicut pueri in maternis uteris constituti non per seipsos nutrimentum accipiunt, sed ex nutrimento matris sustentantur, ita etiam pueri non habentes usum rationis, quasi in utero matris Ecclesiae constituti, non per seipsos, sed per actum Ecclesiae salutem suscipiunt. Unde Augustinus dicit, in libro de peccatorum meritis et Remiss., mater Ecclesia os maternum parvulis praebet, ut sacris mysteriis imbuantur, quia nondum possunt corde proprio credere ad iustitiam, nec ore proprio confiteri ad salutem. Si autem propterea recte fideles vocantur quoniam fidem per verba gestantium quodammodo profitentur, cur etiam non poenitentes habeantur, cum per eorundem verba gestantium Diabolo et huic saeculo abrenuntiare monstrentur? Et eadem ratione possunt dici intendentes, non per actum propriae intentionis, cum ipsi quandoque contranitantur et plorent, sed per actum eorum a quibus offeruntur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The spiritual regeneration effected by Baptism is somewhat like carnal birth, in this respect, that as the child while in the mother's womb receives nourishment not independently, but through the nourishment of its mother, so also children before the use of reason, being as it were in the womb of their mother the Church, receive salvation not by their own act, but by the act of the Church. Hence Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i): "The Church, our mother, offers her maternal mouth for her children, that they may imbibe the sacred mysteries: for they cannot as yet with their own hearts believe unto justice, nor with their own mouths confess unto salvation... And if they are rightly said to believe, because in a certain fashion they make profession of faith by the words of their sponsors, why should they not also be said to repent, since by the words of those same sponsors they evidence their renunciation of the devil and this world?" For the same reason they can be said to intend, not by their own act of intention, since at times they struggle and cry; but by the act of those who bring them to be baptized.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus, scribens Bonifacio, dicit, in Ecclesia salvatoris parvuli per alios credunt, sicut ex aliis quae in Baptismo remittuntur peccata traxerunt. Nec impeditur eorum salus si parentes sint infideles, quia, sicut Augustinus dicit, eidem Bonifacio scribens, offeruntur parvuli ad percipiendam spiritualem gratiam, non tam ab eis quorum gestantur manibus (quamvis et ab ipsis, si et ipsi boni fideles sunt), quam ab universa societate sanctorum atque fidelium. Ab omnibus namque offerri recte intelliguntur, quibus placet quod offeruntur, et quorum caritate ad communionem sancti spiritus adiunguntur. Infidelitas autem propriorum parentum, etiam si eos post Baptismum Daemoniorum sacrificiis imbuere conentur, pueris non nocet. Quia, ut ibidem Augustinus dicit, puer semel generatus per aliorum voluntatem, deinceps non potest vinculo alienae iniquitatis obstringi, ubi nulla sua voluntate consentit, secundum illud, Ezech. XVIII, sicut anima patris mea est, et anima filii, anima quae peccaverit, ipsa morietur. Sed ideo ex Adam traxit quod sacramenti illius gratia solveretur, quia nondum erat anima separata vivens. Fides autem unius, immo totius Ecclesiae, parvulo prodest per operationem spiritus sancti, qui unit Ecclesiam et bona unius alteri communicat.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 As Augustine says, writing to Boniface (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i), "in the Church of our Saviour little children believe through others, just as they contracted from others those sins which are remitted in Baptism." Nor is it a hindrance to their salvation if their parents be unbelievers, because, as Augustine says, writing to the same Boniface (Ep. xcviii), "little children are offered that they may receive grace in their souls, not so much from the hands of those that carry them (yet from these too, if they be good and faithful) as from the whole company of the saints and the faithful. For they are rightly considered to be offered by those who are pleased at their being offered, and by whose charity they are united in communion with the Holy Ghost." And the unbelief of their own parents, even if after Baptism these strive to infect them with the worship of demons, hurts not the children. For as Augustine says (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i) "when once the child has been begotten by the will of others, he cannot subsequently be held by the bonds of another's sin so long as he consent not with his will, according to" Ezech. 18:4: "'As the soul of the Father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.' Yet he contracted from Adam that which was loosed by the grace of this sacrament, because as yet he was not endowed with a separate existence." But the faith of one, indeed of the whole Church, profits the child through the operation of the Holy Ghost, Who unites the Church together, and communicates the goods of one member to another.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut puer, cum baptizatur, non per seipsum, sed per alios credit; ita non per seipsum, sed per alios interrogatur, et interrogati confitentur fidem Ecclesiae in persona pueri, qui huic fidei aggregatur per fidei sacramentum. Conscientiam autem bonam consequitur puer etiam in seipso, non quidem actu, sed habitu, per gratiam iustificantem.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Just as a child, when he is being baptized, believes not by himself but by others, so is he examined not by himself but through others, and these in answer confess the Church's faith in the child's stead, who is aggregated to this faith by the sacrament of faith. And the child acquires a good conscience in himself, not indeed as to the act, but as to the habit, by sanctifying grace.
