# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de particularibus medicinis. Baptismus autem operatur in virtute passionis Christi, quae est universalis medicina omnium peccatorum, et per Baptismum omnia peccata solvuntur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This argument is true of special remedies. But Baptism operates by the power of Christ's Passion, which is the universal remedy for all sins; and so by Baptism all sins are loosed.

Ad quartum dicendum quod sanitas corporalis non est per se effectus Baptismi, sed est quoddam miraculosum opus providentiae divinae.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Bodily health is not the essential effect of Baptism, but a miraculous work of Divine providence.

Ad tertium dicendum quod effectus Baptismi non est tollere peccata futura, sed praesentia vel praeterita. Et ideo, recedente fictione, peccata sequentia remittuntur quidem, sed per poenitentiam, non per Baptismum. Unde non remittuntur quantum ad totum reatum, sicut peccata praecedentia Baptismum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The effect of Baptism is to take away not future, but present and past sins. And consequently, when the insincerity passes away, subsequent sins are indeed remitted, but by Penance, not by Baptism. Wherefore they are not remitted, like the sins which preceded Baptism, as to the whole debt of punishment.
