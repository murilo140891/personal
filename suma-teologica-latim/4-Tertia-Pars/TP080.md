# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod ad societatem corporis mystici pertinent quidem et homines per fidem, Angeli autem per manifestam visionem. Sacramenta autem proportionantur fidei, per quam veritas videtur in speculo et in aenigmate. Et ideo hic, proprie loquendo, non Angelis, sed hominibus proprie convenit manducare spiritualiter hoc sacramentum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Both men and angels belong to the fellowship of His mystical body; men by faith, and angels by manifest vision. But the sacraments are proportioned to faith, through which the truth is seen "through a glass" and "in a dark manner." And therefore, properly speaking, it does not belong to angels, but to men, to eat this sacrament spiritually.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus manet in hominibus secundum praesentem statum per fidem, sed in Angelis beatis est per manifestam visionem. Et ideo non est simile, sicut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ dwells in men through faith, according to their present state, but He is in the blessed angels by manifest vision. Consequently the comparison does not hold, as stated above (ad 2).

Secundum tamen antiquos canones statutum fuit a Papa Clemente, ut habetur de Consecr., dist. II, si mane dominica portio editur, usque ad sextam ieiunent ministri qui eam sumpserunt, et si tertia vel quarta acceperint, ieiunent usque ad vesperum. Antiquitus enim rarius Missarum solemnia celebrabantur, et cum maiori praeparatione. Nunc autem, quia oportet frequentius sacra mysteria celebrare, non posset de facili observari. Et ideo per contrariam consuetudinem est abrogatum.
        
However, according to the ancient Canons, the following ordination was made by Pope Clement I, (Ep. ii), "If the Lord's portion be eaten in the morning, the ministers who have taken it shall fast until the sixth hour, and if they take it at the third or fourth hour, they shall fast until evening." For in olden times, the priest celebrated Mass less frequently, and with greater preparation: but now, because the sacred mysteries have to be celebrated oftener, the same could not be easily observed, and so it has been abrogated by contrary custom.

Ad tertium dicendum quod peccatores magnum detrimentum patiuntur ex hoc quod repelluntur a perceptione huius sacramenti, unde per hoc non sunt melioris conditionis. Et licet in peccatis permanentes non excusentur propter hoc a transgressione praecepti, poenitens tamen, qui, ut Innocentius dicit, secundum consilium sacerdotis abstinet, excusatur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Sinners suffer great loss in being kept back from receiving this sacrament, so that they are not better off on that account; and although while continuing in their sins they are not on that account excused from transgressing the precept, nevertheless, as Pope Innocent III says, penitents, "who refrain on the advice of their priest," are excused.
