# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod homo sic debet esse sine offensione omnibus ut nulli det suo facto vel dicto minus recto occasionem ruinae. Si tamen de veritate scandalum oritur, magis est sustinendum scandalum quam veritas relinquatur, ut Gregorius dicit.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 A man ought so to avoid giving offense, as neither by wrong deed or word to be the occasion of anyone's downfall. "But if scandal arise from truth, the scandal should be borne rather than the truth be set aside," as Gregory says (Hom. vii in Ezech.).




Ad secundum dicendum quod per hoc quod Christus publice Scribas et Pharisaeos arguebat, non impedivit, sed magis promovit effectum suae doctrinae. Quia cum eorum vitia populo innotescebant, minus avertebatur a Christo propter verba Scribarum et Pharisaeorum, qui semper doctrinae Christi obsistebant.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 By publicly reproving the Scribes and Pharisees, Christ promoted rather than hindered the effect of His teaching. Because when the people came to know the vices of those men, they were less inclined to be prejudiced against Christ by hearing what was said of Him by the Scribes and Pharisees, who were ever withstanding His doctrine.




Ad tertium dicendum quod illud verbum apostoli est intelligendum de illis senioribus qui non solum aetate vel auctoritate, sed etiam honestate sunt senes, secundum illud Num. XI, congrega mihi septuaginta viros de senioribus Israel, quos tu nosti quod senes populi sint. Si autem auctoritatem senectutis in instrumentum malitiae vertant publice peccando, sunt manifeste et acriter arguendi, sicut et Daniel dixit, Dan. XIII, inveterate dierum malorum, et cetera.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 This saying of the Apostle is to be understood of those elders whose years are reckoned not only in age and authority, but also in probity; according to Num. 11:16: "Gather unto Me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients... of the people." But if by sinning openly they turn the authority of their years into an instrument of wickedness, they should be rebuked openly and severely, as also Daniel says (
Dan. 13:52
): "O thou that art grown old in evil days," etc.

Quod autem dicitur quod sine parabolis non loquebatur eis, secundum Chrysostomum intelligendum est quantum ad illum sermonem, quamvis alias et sine parabolis multa turbis locutus fuerit. Vel, secundum Augustinum, in libro de quaest. Evang., hoc dicitur, non quia nihil proprie locutus est, sed quia nullum fere sermonem explicavit ubi non per parabolam aliquid significaverit, quamvis in eo aliqua proprie dixerit.
        
And when it is said that "without parables He did not speak to them," according to Chrysostom (Hom. xlvii in Matth.), we are to understand this of that particular sermon, since on other occasions He said many things to the multitude without parables. Or, as Augustine says (De Qq. Evang., qu. xvii), this means, "not that He spoke nothing literally, but that He scarcely ever spoke without introducing a parable, although He also spoke some things in the literal sense."
