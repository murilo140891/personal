# Summa Theologica

Circa primum occurrit quadruplex consideratio, quarum
          


prima est de ipsa Christi resurrectione;
            
secunda, de qualitate resurgentis;
            
tertia, de manifestatione resurrectionis;
            
quarta, de eius causalitate.
          



          Under the first heading there is a fourfold consideration:
          


(1) Christ's Resurrection in itself;
            
(2) the quality of the Person rising;
            
(3) the manifestation of the Resurrection;
            
(4) its causality.
          




Circa primum quaeruntur quatuor.
        
Concerning the first there are four points of inquiry:




Primo, de necessitate resurrectionis eius.
        


(1)
 The necessity of His Resurrection;
      


Secundo, de tempore.
        


(2)
 The time of the Resurrection;
      


Tertio, de ordine.
        


(3)
 Its order;
      


Quarto, de causa.
        


(4)
 Its cause.

Tertio, de ordine.
        


(3)
 Its order;
      


Quarto, de causa.
        


(4)
 Its cause.

Quarto, de causa.
        


(4)
 Its cause.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, licet Christus non ceciderit per peccatum, cecidit tamen per mortem, quia sicut peccatum est casus a iustitia, ita mors est casus a vita. Unde ex persona Christi potest intelligi quod dicitur Mich. VII, ne laeteris, inimica mea, super me, quia cecidi, consurgam. Similiter etiam, licet corpus Christi non fuerit dissolutum per incinerationem, ipsa tamen separatio animae a corpore dissolutio quaedam fuit.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although Christ did not fall by sin, yet He fell by death, because as sin is a fall from righteousness, so death is a fall from life: hence the words of Micheas 7:8 can be taken as though spoken by Christ: "Rejoice not thou, my enemy, over me, because I am fallen: I shall rise again." Likewise, although Christ's body was not disintegrated by returning to dust, yet the separation of His soul and body was a kind of disintegration.




Ad secundum dicendum quod divinitas erat carni Christi post mortem unita unione personali, non autem unione naturae, sicut anima unitur corpori ut forma ad constituendam humanam naturam. Et ideo per hoc quod corpus eius unitum est animae, promotum est in altiorem statum naturae, non autem in altiorem statum personae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The Godhead was united with Christ's flesh after death by personal union, but not by natural union; thus the soul is united with the body as its form, so as to constitute human nature. Consequently, by the union of the body and soul, the body was uplifted to a higher condition of nature, but not to a higher personal state.




Ad tertium dicendum quod passio Christi operata est nostram salutem, proprie loquendo, quantum ad remotionem malorum, resurrectio autem quantum ad inchoationem et exemplar bonorum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ's Passion wrought our salvation, properly speaking, by removing evils; but the Resurrection did so as the beginning and exemplar of all good things.
