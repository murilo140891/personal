 Of the order observed in the Annunciation.

Secundo, ut posset esse certior testis huius sacramenti, quando super hoc divinitus erat instructa.
        
Secondly, that she might be a more certain witness of this mystery, being instructed therein by God.




Tertio, ut voluntaria sui obsequii munera Deo offerret, ad quod se promptam obtulit, dicens, ecce ancilla domini.
        
Thirdly, that she might offer to God the free gift of her obedience: which she proved herself right ready to do, saying: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord."




Quarto, ut ostenderetur esse quoddam spirituale matrimonium inter filium Dei et humanam naturam. Et ideo per Annuntiationem expetebatur consensus virginis loco totius humanae naturae.
        
Fourthly, in order to show that there is a certain spiritual wedlock between the Son of God and human nature. Wherefore in the Annunciation the Virgin's consent was besought in lieu of that of the entire human nature.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod prophetia praedestinationis completur sine nostro arbitrio causante, non tamen sine nostro arbitrio consentiente.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The prophecy of predestination is fulfilled without the causality of our will; not without its consent.




Ad secundum dicendum quod beata virgo expressam fidem habebat incarnationis futurae, sed, cum esset humilis, non tam alta de se sapiebat. Et ideo super hoc erat instruenda.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The Blessed Virgin did indeed believe explicitly in the future Incarnation; but, being humble, she did not think such high things of herself. Consequently she required instruction in this matter.




Ad tertium dicendum quod spiritualem conceptionem Christi, quae est per fidem, praecedit Annuntiatio quae est per fidei praedicationem, secundum quod fides est ex auditu, ut dicitur Rom. X. Nec tamen propter hoc aliquis pro certo scit se gratiam habere, sed scit veram fidem esse quam accipit.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The spiritual conception of Christ through faith is preceded by the preaching of the faith, for as much as "faith is by hearing" (
Rm. 10:17
). Yet man does not know for certain thereby that he has grace; but he does know that the faith, which he has received, is true.

Fourthly, in order to show that there is a certain spiritual wedlock between the Son of God and human nature. Wherefore in the Annunciation the Virgin's consent was besought in lieu of that of the entire human nature.

Nec tamen propter hoc aliquis pro certo scit se gratiam habere, sed scit veram fidem esse quam accipit.

Ad quartum dicendum quod quidam dicunt Gabrielem fuisse de supremo ordine, propter hoc quod Gregorius dicit, summum Angelum venire dignum fuerat, qui summum omnium nuntiabat. Sed ex hoc non habetur quod fuerit summus inter omnes ordines, sed respectu Angelorum, fuit enim de ordine Archangelorum. Unde et Ecclesia eum Archangelum nominat, et Gregorius ipse dicit, in homilia de centum ovibus, quod Archangeli dicuntur qui summa annuntiant. Satis est ergo credibile quod sit summus in ordine Archangelorum. Et, sicut Gregorius dicit, hoc nomen officio suo congruit, Gabriel enim Dei fortitudo nominatur. Per Dei ergo fortitudinem nuntiandum erat quia virtutum dominus et potens in praelio ad debellandas potestates aereas veniebat.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Some say that Gabriel was of the highest order; because Gregory says (Hom. de Centum Ovibus [*34 in Evang.]): "It was right that one of the highest angels should come, since his message was most sublime." But this does nat imply that he was of the highest order of all, but in regard to the angels: since he was an archangel. Thus the Church calls him an archangel, and Gregory himself in a homily (De Centum Ovibus 34) says that "those are called archangels who announce sublime things." It is therefore sufficiently credible that he was the highest of the archangels. And, as Gregory says (De Centum Ovibus 34), this name agrees with his office: for "Gabriel means 'Power of God.' This message therefore was fittingly brought by the 'Power of God,' because the Lord of hosts and mighty in battle was coming to overcome the powers of the air."

Quidam tamen dicunt quod, cum beata virgo assueta esset visionibus Angelorum, non fuit turbata in visione Angeli, sed in admiratione eorum quae ei ab Angelo dicebantur, quia de se tam magnifica non cogitabat. Unde et Evangelista non dicit quod turbata fuerit in visione Angeli, sed, in sermone eius.
        
But others says that as the Blessed Virgin was accustomed to angelic visions, she was not troubled at seeing this angel, but with wonder at hearing what the angel said to her, for she did not think so highly of herself. Wherefore the evangelist does not say that she was troubled at seeing the angel, but "at his saying."

Augustinus tamen videtur dicere quod dubitaverit. Dicit enim, in libro quaestionum veteris et novi Test., ambigenti Mariae de conceptu, possibilitatem Angelus praedicat. Sed talis dubitatio magis est admirationis quam incredulitatis. Et ideo Angelus probationem inducit, non ad auferendam infidelitatem, sed ad removendam eius admirationem.
        
Augustine, however, seems to assert that she doubted. For he says (De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. li): "To Mary, in doubt about the conception, the angel declares the possibility thereof." But such a doubt is one of wonder rather than of unbelief. And so the angel adduces a proof, not as a cure for unbelief, but in order to remove her astonishment.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Ambrosius dicit, in Hexaemeron, ob hoc multae steriles praevenerunt, ut partus credatur virginis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Ambrose says (Hexaemeron v): "For this reason had many barren women borne children, that the virginal birth might be credible."




Et ideo conceptus Elisabeth sterilis inducitur, non quasi sufficiens argumentum, sed quasi quoddam figurale exemplum. Et ideo, ad confirmationem huius exempli, subditur argumentum efficax ex omnipotentia divina.
        
The conception of the sterile Elizabeth is therefore adduced, not as a sufficient argument, but as a kind of figurative example.: consequently in support of this instance, the convincing argument is added taken from the Divine omnipotence.
