Respondeo dicendum quod conveniens fuit Christum ad Infernum descendere. Primo quidem, quia ipse venerat poenam nostram portare, ut nos a poena eriperet, secundum illud Isaiae LIII, vere languores nostros ipse tulit, et dolores nostros ipse portavit. Ex peccato autem homo incurrerat non solum mortem corporis, sed etiam descensum ad Inferos. Et ideo, sicut fuit conveniens eum mori ut nos liberaret a morte, ita conveniens fuit eum descendere ad Inferos ut nos a descensu ad Inferos liberaret. Unde dicitur Osee XIII, ero mors tua, o mors. Ero morsus tuus, Inferne. Secundo, quia conveniens erat ut, victo Diabolo per passionem, vinctos eius eriperet, qui detinebantur in Inferno, secundum illud Zach. IX, tu quoque in sanguine testamenti tui vinctos tuos emisisti de lacu. Et Coloss. II dicitur, exspolians principatus et potestates, traduxit confidenter. Tertio ut, sicut potestatem suam ostendit in terra vivendo et moriendo, ita etiam potestatem suam ostenderet in Inferno, ipsum visitando et illuminando; unde dicitur in Psalmo, attollite portas, principes, vestras, Glossa, idest, principes Inferni, auferte potestatem vestram, qua usque nunc homines in Inferno detinebatis; et sic in nomine Iesu omne genu flectatur, non solum caelestium, sed etiam Infernorum, ut dicitur Philipp. II.
        

          I answer that It was fitting for Christ to descend into hell. First of all, because He came to bear our penalty in order to free us from penalty, according to Is. 53:4: "Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows." But through sin man had incurred not only the death of the body, but also descent into hell. Consequently since it was fitting for Christ to die in order to deliver us from death, so it was fitting for Him to descend into hell in order to deliver us also from going down into hell. Hence it is written (Osee 13:14): "O death, I will be thy death; O hell, I will be thy bite." Secondly, because it was fitting when the devil was overthrown by the Passion that Christ should deliver the captives detained in hell, according to Zach. 9:11: "Thou also by the blood of Thy Testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit." And it is written (Col. 2:15): "Despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently." Thirdly, that as He showed forth His power on earth by living and dying, so also He might manifest it in hell, by visiting it and enlightening it. Accordingly it is written (
Ps. 23:7
): "Lift up your gates, O ye princes," which the gloss thus interprets: "that is---Ye princes of hell, take away your power, whereby hitherto you held men fast in hell"; and so "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow," not only "of them that are in heaven," but likewise "of them that are in hell," as is said in Phil. 2:10.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod nomen Infernorum sonat in malum poenae, non autem in malum culpae. Unde decuit Christum in Infernum descendere, non tanquam ipse esset debitor poena, sed ut eos qui erant poenae obnoxii, liberaret.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The name of hell stands for an evil of penalty, and not for an evil of guilt. Hence it was becoming that Christ should descend into hell, not as liable to punishment Himself, but to deliver them who were.




Ad secundum dicendum quod passio Christi fuit quaedam causa universalis humanae salutis, tam vivorum quam mortuorum. Causa autem universalis applicatur ad singulares effectus per aliquid speciale. Unde, sicut virtus passionis Christi applicatur viventibus per sacramenta configurantia nos passioni Christi, ita etiam applicata est mortuis per descensum Christi ad Inferos. Propter quod signanter dicitur Zach. IX, quod eduxit vinctos de lacu in sanguine testamenti sui, idest per virtutem passionis suae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ's Passion was a kind of universal cause of men's salvation, both of the living and of the dead. But a general cause is applied to particular effects by means of something special. Hence, as the power of the Passion is applied to the living through the sacraments which make us like unto Christ's Passion, so likewise it is applied to the dead through His descent into hell. On which account it is written (Zach. 9:11) that "He sent forth prisoners out of the pit, in the blood of His testament," that is, by the power of His Passion.




Ad tertium dicendum quod anima Christi non descenderit ad Inferos eo genere motus quo corpora moventur, sed eo genere motus quo Angeli moventur, sicut in prima parte habitum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ's soul descended into hell not by the same kind of motion as that whereby bodies are moved, but by that kind whereby the angels are moved, as was said in the FP, Question [53], Article [1].

Ad tertium dicendum quod illud verbum domini est intelligendum, non de Paradiso terrestri corporeo, sed de Paradiso spirituali, in quo esse dicuntur quicumque divina gloria perfruuntur. Unde latro loco quidem cum Christo ad Infernum descendit, ut cum Christo esset, quia dictum est ei, mecum eris in Paradiso, sed praemio in Paradiso fuit, quia ibi divinitate Christi fruebatur, sicut et alii sancti.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Our Lord's expression is not to be understood of the earthly corporeal paradise, but of a spiritual one, in which all are said to be who enjoy the Divine glory. Accordingly, the thief descended locally into hell with Christ, because it was said to him: "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise"; still as to reward he was in paradise, because he enjoyed Christ's Godhead just as the other saints did.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Augustinus ibi loquitur contra quosdam qui aestimabant antiquos iustos, ante adventum Christi, in Inferno doloribus poenarum fuisse subiectos. Unde, parum ante verba inducta, praemittit dicens, addunt quidam hoc beneficium antiquis etiam sanctis fuisse concessum, ut, dominus cum in Infernum venisset, ab illis doloribus solverentur. Sed quonam modo intelligatur Abraham, in cuius sinum pius etiam pauper ille susceptus est, in illis fuisse doloribus, ego quidem non video. Et ideo, cum postea subdit se nondum invenisse quid descensus Christi ad Inferos antiquis iustis contulerit, intelligendum est quantum ad absolutionem a doloribus poenarum. Contulit tamen eis quantum ad adeptionem gloriae, et per consequens solvit eorum dolorem quem patiebantur ex dilatione gloriae. Ex cuius tamen spe magnum gaudium habebant, secundum illud Ioan. VIII, Abraham, pater vester, exultavit ut videret diem meum. Et ideo subdit, a quibus eum, secundum beatificam praesentiam suae divinitatis, nunquam video recessisse, inquantum scilicet, etiam ante adventum Christi, erant beati in spe, licet nondum essent perfecte beati in re.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Augustine is speaking there against such as maintained that the righteous of old were subject to penal sufferings before Christ's descent into hell. Hence shortly before the passage quoted he says: "Some add that this benefit was also bestowed upon the saints of old, that on the Lord's coming into hell they were freed from their sufferings. But I fail to see how Abraham, into whose bosom the poor man was received, was ever in such sufferings." Consequently, when he afterwards adds that "he had not yet discovered what Christ's descent into hell had brought to the righteous of old," this must be understood as to their being freed from penal sufferings. Yet Christ bestowed something upon them as to their attaining glory: and in consequence He dispelled the suffering which they endured through their glory being delayed: still they had great joy from the very hope thereof, according to Jn. 8:56: "Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day." And therefore he adds: "I fail to see that He ever departed, according to the beatific presence of His Godhead," that is, inasmuch as even before Christ's coming they were happy in hope, although not yet fully happy in fact.




Ad secundum dicendum quod sancti patres, dum adhuc viverent, liberati fuerunt per fidem Christi ab omni peccato tam originali quam actuali, et reatu poenae actualium peccatorum, non tamen a reatu poenae originalis peccati, per quem excludebantur a gloria, nondum soluto pretio redemptionis humanae. Sicut etiam nunc fideles Christi liberantur per Baptismum a reatu actualium peccatorum, et a reatu originalis quantum ad exclusionem a gloria, remanent tamen adhuc obligati reatu originalis peccati quantum ad necessitatem corporaliter moriendi; quia renovantur secundum spiritum, sed nondum secundum carnem, secundum illud Rom. VIII, corpus quidem mortuum est propter peccatum, spiritus vero vivit propter iustificationem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The holy Fathers while yet living were delivered from original as well as actual sin through faith in Christ; also from the penalty of actual sins, but not from the penalty of original sin, whereby they were excluded from glory, since the price of man's redemption was not yet paid: just as the faithful are now delivered by baptism from the penalty of actual sins, and from the penalty of original sin as to exclusion from glory, yet still remain bound by the penalty of original sin as to the necessity of dying in the body because they are renewed in the spirit, but not yet in the flesh, according to Rm. 8:10: "The body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification."




Ad tertium dicendum quod statim, Christo mortem patiente, anima eius ad Infernum descendit, et suae passionis fructum exhibuit sanctis in Inferno detentis, quamvis ex loco illo non exierint, Christo apud Inferos commorante, quia ipsa Christi praesentia pertinebat ad cumulum gloriae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Directly Christ died His soul went down into hell, and bestowed the fruits of His Passion on the saints detained there; although they did not go out as long as Christ remained in hell, because His presence was part of the fulness of their glory.

Ad secundum dicendum quod, cum apostolus dicit, gratia Dei in plures abundavit, ly plures non est accipiendum comparative, quasi plures numero sint salvati per gratiam Christi quam damnati per peccatum Adae, sed absolute, ac si diceret quod gratia unius Christi abundavit in multos, sicut et peccatum unius Adae pervenit ad multos. Sed sicut peccatum Adae ad eos tantum pervenit qui per seminalem rationem carnaliter ab eo descenderunt, ita gratia Christi ad illos tantum pervenit qui spirituali regeneratione eius membra sunt facti. Quod non competit pueris decedentibus cum originali peccato.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 When the Apostle says that the grace of God "hath abounded unto many," the word "many" [*The Vulgate reads 'plures,' i.e. 'many more'] is to be taken, not comparatively, as if more were saved by Christ's grace than lost by Adam's sin: but absolutely, as if he said that the grace of the one Christ abounded unto many, just as Adam's sin was contracted by many. But as Adam's sin was contracted by those only who descended seminally from him according to the flesh, so Christ's grace reached those only who became His members by spiritual regeneration: which does not apply to children dying in original sin.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismus adhibetur hominibus in hac vita, in qua homo potest transmutari de culpa in gratiam. Sed descensus Christi ad Inferos exhibitus fuit animabus post hanc vitam, ubi non sunt capaces transmutationis praedictae. Et ideo per Baptismum pueri liberantur a peccato originali et ab Inferno, non autem per descensum Christi ad Inferos.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Baptism is applied to men in this life, in which man's state can be changed from sin into grace: but Christ's descent into hell was vouchsafed to the souls after this life when they are no longer capable of the said change. And consequently by baptism children are delivered from original sin and from hell, but not by Christ's descent into hell.

Ad tertium dicendum quod illi defectus a quibus Christus simul in hoc mundo homines liberabat, erant personales, proprie ad unumquemque pertinentes. Sed exclusio a gloria Dei erat quidam defectus generalis pertinens ad totam humanam naturam. Et ideo nihil prohibet eos qui erant in Purgatorio, per Christum esse liberatos ab exclusione a gloria, non autem a reatu poenae Purgatorii, qui pertinet ad proprium defectum. Sicut e converso sancti patres, ante Christi adventum, liberati sunt a propriis defectibus, non autem a defectu communi, sicut supra dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Those defects from which Christ altogether delivered men in this world were purely personal, and concerned the individual; whereas exclusion from God's glory was a general defect and common to all human nature. Consequently, there was nothing to prevent those detained in Purgatory being delivered by Christ from their privation of glory, but not from the debt of punishment in Purgatory which pertains to personal defect. Just as on the other hand, the holy Fathers before Christ's coming were delivered from their personal defects, but not from the common defect, as was stated above (
