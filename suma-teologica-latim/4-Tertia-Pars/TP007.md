# Summa Theologica

Tertiodecimo, qualiter haec gratia se habeat ad unionem.
        


(13)
 How this grace stood towards the union?

Ad tertium sic proceditur. Videtur quod in Christo fuerit fides. Fides enim est nobilior virtus quam virtutes morales, puta temperantia et liberalitas. Huiusmodi autem virtutes fuerunt in Christo, ut dictum est. Multum ergo magis fuit in eo fides.
        


Objection 1:
 It would seem that there was faith in Christ. For faith is a nobler virtue than the moral virtues, e.g. temperance and liberality. Now these were in Christ, as stated above (
Article [2]
). Much more, therefore, was there faith in Him.




Praeterea, Christus non docuit virtutes quas ipse non habuit, secundum illud Act. I, coepit Iesus facere et docere. Sed de Christo dicitur, Heb. XII, quod est auctor et consummator fidei. Ergo in eo maxime fuit fides.
        


Objection 2:
 Further, Christ did not teach virtues which He had not Himself, according to Acts 1:1: "Jesus began to do and to teach." But of Christ it is said (
Heb. 12:2
) that He is "the author and finisher of our faith." Therefore there was faith in Him before all others.




Praeterea, quidquid est imperfectionis excluditur a beatis. Sed in beatis est fides, nam super illud Rom. I, iustitia Dei revelatur in eo ex fide in fidem, dicit Glossa, de fide verborum et spei in fidem rerum et speciei. Ergo videtur quod etiam in Christo fuerit fides, cum nihil imperfectionis importet.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, everything imperfect is excluded from the blessed. But in the blessed there is faith; for on Rm. 1:17, "the justice of God is revealed therein from faith to faith," a gloss says: "From the faith of words and hope to the faith of things and sight." Therefore it would seem that in Christ also there was faith, since it implies nothing imperfect.




Sed contra est quod dicitur Heb. XI, quod fides est argumentum non apparentium. Sed Christo nihil fuit non apparens, secundum illud quod dixit ei Petrus, Ioan. ult., tu omnia nosti. Ergo in Christo non fuit fides.
        


On the contrary,
 It is written (
Heb. 11:1
): "Faith is the evidence of things that appear not." But there was nothing that did not appear to Christ, according to what Peter said to Him (
Jn. 21:17
): "Thou knowest all things." Therefore there was no faith in Christ.
      


Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut in secunda parte dictum est, obiectum fidei est res divina non visa. Habitus autem virtutis, sicut et quilibet alius, recipit speciem ab obiecto. Et ideo, excluso quod res divina non sit visa, excluditur ratio fidei. Christus autem in primo instanti suae conceptionis plene vidit Deum per essentiam, ut infra patebit. Unde fides in eo esse non potuit.
        


I answer that,
 As was said above (
SS
, 
Question [1]
, 
Article [4]
), the object of faith is a Divine thing not seen. Now the habit of virtue, as every other habit, takes its species from the object. Hence, if we deny that the Divine thing was not seen, we exclude the very essence of faith. Now from the first moment of His conception Christ saw God's Essence fully, as will be made clear (
Question [34]
, 
Article [1]
). Hence there could be no faith in Him.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod fides est nobilior virtutibus moralibus, quia est circa nobiliorem materiam, sed tamen importat quendam defectum in comparatione ad illam materiam, qui defectus in Christo non fuit. Et ideo non potuit in eo esse fides, licet fuerint in eo virtutes morales, quae in sui ratione huiusmodi defectum non important per comparationem ad suas materias.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Faith is a nobler virtue than the moral virtues, seeing that it has to do with nobler matter; nevertheless, it implies a certain defect with regard to that matter; and this defect was not in Christ. And hence there could be no faith in Him, although the moral virtues were in Him, since in their nature they imply no defect with regard to their matter.




Ad secundum dicendum quod meritum fidei consistit in hoc quod homo, ex obedientia Dei, assentit istis quae non videt, secundum illud Rom. I, ad obediendum fidei in omnibus gentibus pro nomine eius. Obedientiam autem ad Deum plenissime habuit Christus, secundum illud Philipp. II, factus est obediens usque ad mortem. Et sic nihil ad meritum pertinens docuit quod ipse excellentius non impleret.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The merit of faith consists in this---that man through obedience assents to what things he does not see, according to Rm. 1:5: "For obedience to the faith in all nations for His name." Now Christ had most perfect obedience to God, according to Phil. 2:8: "Becoming obedient unto death." And hence He taught nothing pertaining to merit which He did not fulfil more perfectly Himself.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Glossa ibidem dicit, fides proprie est qua creduntur quae non videntur. Sed fides quae est rerum visarum, improprie dicitur, et secundum quandam similitudinem, quantum ad certitudinem aut firmitatem adhaesionis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As a gloss says in the same place, faith is that "whereby such things as are not seen are believed." But faith in things seen is improperly so called, and only after a certain similitude with regard to the certainty and firmness of the assent.

Praeterea, Christus non docuit virtutes quas ipse non habuit, secundum illud Act. I, coepit Iesus facere et docere. Sed de Christo dicitur, Heb. XII, quod est auctor et consummator fidei. Ergo in eo maxime fuit fides.

Ad tertium dicendum quod in Christo non solum fuit cognitio patriae, sed etiam cognitio viae, ut infra dicetur. Et tamen etiam in patria sunt per aliquem modum dona spiritus sancti, ut in secunda parte habitum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 In Christ there was not only heavenly knowledge, but also earthly knowledge, as will be said (
Question [15]
, 
Article [10]
). And yet even in heaven the gifts of the Holy Ghost will still exist, in a certain manner, as was said above (
FS
, 
Question [68]
, 
Article [6]
).

Ad tertium dicendum quod perfecta caritas foras mittit timorem servilem, qui respicit principaliter poenam. Sic autem timor non fuit in Christo.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Perfect charity casts out servile fear, which principally regards punishment. But this kind of fear was not in Christ.

Ad secundum dicendum quod fides est eorum quae non videntur ab ipso credente. Similiter spes est eorum quae non habentur ab ipso sperante. Sed prophetia est eorum quae sunt procul a communi hominum sensu, cum quibus propheta conversatur et communicat in statu viae. Et ideo fides et spes repugnant perfectioni beatitudinis Christi, non autem prophetia.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Faith regards such things as are unseen by him who believes; and hope, too, is of such things as are not possessed by the one who hopes; but prophecy is of such things as are beyond the sense of men, with whom the prophet dwells and converses in this state of life. And hence faith and hope are repugnant to the perfection of Christ's beatitude; but prophecy is not.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Angelus, cum sit comprehensor, est supra prophetam qui est purus viator, non autem supra Christum, qui simul fuit viator et comprehensor.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Angels, being "comprehensors," are above prophets, who are merely "wayfarers"; but not above Christ, Who was both a "comprehensor" and a "wayfarer."

Ad tertium dicendum quod in sapientia et gratia aliquis potest proficere dupliciter. Uno modo, secundum ipsos habitus sapientiae et gratiae augmentatos. Et sic Christus in eis non proficiebat. Alio modo, secundum effectus, inquantum scilicet aliquis sapientiora et virtuosiora opera facit. Et sic Christus proficiebat sapientia et gratia, sicut et aetate, quia secundum processum aetatis perfectiora opera faciebat, ut se verum hominem demonstraret, et in his quae sunt ad Deum et in his quae sunt ad homines.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Anyone may increase in wisdom and grace in two ways. First inasmuch as the very habits of wisdom and grace are increased; and in this way Christ did not increase. Secondly, as regards the effects, i.e. inasmuch as they do wiser and greater works; and in this way Christ increased in wisdom and grace even as in age, since in the course of time He did more perfect works, to prove Himself true man, both in the things of God, and in the things of man.
