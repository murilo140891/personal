# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, licet Christus non sit passus secundum quod Deus, tamen caro eius est divinitatis instrumentum. Et ex hoc passio eius habet quandam divinam virtutem ad expellendum peccatum, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although Christ did not suffer as God, nevertheless His flesh is the instrument of the Godhead; and hence it is that His Passion has a kind of Divine Power of casting out sin, as was said above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod passio Christi, licet sit corporalis, sortitur tamen quandam spiritualem virtutem ex divinitate, cuius caro ei unita est instrumentum. Secundum quam quidem virtutem passio Christi est causa remissionis peccatorum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although Christ's Passion is corporeal, still it derives a kind of spiritual energy from the Godhead, to which the flesh is united as an instrument: and according to this power Christ's Passion is the cause of the forgiveness of sins.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus sua passione a peccatis nos liberavit causaliter, idest, instituens causam nostrae liberationis, ex qua possent quaecumque peccata quandocumque remitti, vel praeterita vel praesentia vel futura, sicut si medicus faciat medicinam ex qua possint etiam quicumque morbi sanari, etiam in futurum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ by His Passion delivered us from our sins causally---that is, by setting up the cause of our deliverance, from which cause all sins whatsoever, past, present, or to come, could be forgiven: just as if a doctor were to prepare a medicine by which all sicknesses can be cured even in future.




Ad quartum dicendum quod, quia passio Christi praecessit ut causa quaedam universalis remissionis peccatorum, sicut dictum est, necesse est quod singulis adhibeatur ad deletionem propriorum peccatorum. Hoc autem fit per Baptismum et poenitentiam et alia sacramenta, quae habent virtutem ex passione Christi, ut infra patebit.
        


Reply to Objection 4:
 As stated above, since Christ's Passion preceded, as a kind of universal cause of the forgiveness of sins, it needs to be applied to each individual for the cleansing of personal sins. Now this is done by baptism and penance and the other sacraments, which derive their power from Christ's Passion, as shall be shown later (

Ad quintum dicendum quod etiam per fidem applicatur nobis passio Christi ad percipiendum fructum ipsius, secundum illud Rom. III, quem proposuit Deus propitiatorem per fidem in sanguine eius. Fides autem per quam a peccato mundamur, non est fides informis, quae potest esse etiam cum peccato, sed est fides formata per caritatem, ut sic passio Christi nobis applicetur non solum quantum ad intellectum, sed etiam quantum ad affectum. Et per hunc etiam modum peccata dimittuntur ex virtute passionis Christi.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 Christ's Passion is applied to us even through faith, that we may share in its fruits, according to Rm. 3:25: "Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood." But the faith through which we are cleansed from sin is not "lifeless faith," which can exist even with sin, but "faith living" through charity; that thus Christ's Passion may be applied to us, not only as to our minds, but also as to our hearts. And even in this way sins are forgiven through the power of the Passion of Christ.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Deus diligit omnes homines quantum ad naturam, quam ipse fecit. Odit tamen eos quantum ad culpam, quam contra eum homines committunt, secundum illud Eccli. XII, altissimus odio habet peccatores.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 God loves all men as to their nature, which He Himself made; yet He hates them with respect to the crimes they commit against Him, according to Ecclus. 12:3: "The Highest hateth sinners."




Ad secundum dicendum quod Christus non dicitur quantum ad hoc nos Deo reconciliasse, quod de novo nos amare inciperet, cum scriptum sit, Ierem. XXXI, in caritate perpetua dilexi te. Sed quia per passionem Christi est sublata odii causa, tum propter ablutionem peccati; tum propter recompensationem acceptabilioris boni.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ is not said to have reconciled us with God, as if God had begun anew to love us, since it is written (
Jer. 31:3
): "I have loved thee with an everlasting love"; but because the source of hatred was taken away by Christ's Passion, both through sin being washed away and through compensation being made in the shape of a more pleasing offering.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut occisores Christi homines fuerunt, ita et Christus occisus. Maior autem fuit caritas Christi patientis quam iniquitas occisorum. Et ideo passio Christi magis valuit ad reconciliandum Deum toti humano generi, quam ad provocandum iram.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Christ's slayers were men, so also was the Christ slain. Now the charity of the suffering Christ surpassed the wickedness of His slayers. Accordingly Christ's Passion prevailed more in reconciling God to the whole human race than in provoking Him to wrath.
