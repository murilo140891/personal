# Summa Theologica

Respondeo dicendum quod illud quod est in potentia, reducitur in actum per id quod est actu, oportet enim esse calidum id per quod alia calefiunt. Homo autem est in potentia ad scientiam beatorum, quae in visione Dei consistit, et ad eam ordinatur sicut ad finem, est enim creatura rationalis capax illius beatae cognitionis, inquantum est ad imaginem Dei. Ad hunc autem finem beatitudinis homines reducuntur per Christi humanitatem, secundum illud Heb. II, decebat eum propter quem omnia et per quem omnia, qui multos filios in gloriam adduxerat, auctorem salutis eorum per passionem consummari. Et ideo oportuit quod cognitio ipsa in Dei visione consistens excellentissime Christo homini conveniret, quia semper causam oportet esse potiorem causato.
        
I answer that,
 What is in potentiality is reduced to act by what is in act; for that whereby things are heated must itself be hot. Now man is in potentiality to the knowledge of the blessed, which consists in the vision of God; and is ordained to it as to an end; since the rational creature is capable of that blessed knowledge, inasmuch as he is made in the image of God. Now men are brought to this end of beatitude by the humanity of Christ, according to Heb. 2:10: "For it became Him, for Whom are all things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many children unto glory, to perfect the author of their salvation by His passion." And hence it was necessary that the beatific knowledge, which consists in the vision of God, should belong to Christ pre-eminently, since the cause ought always to be more efficacious than the effect.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod divinitas unita est humanitati Christi secundum personam, et non secundum naturam vel essentiam, sed cum unitate personae remanet distinctio naturarum. Et ideo anima Christi, quae est pars humanae naturae, per aliquod lumen participatum a natura divina perfecta est ad scientiam beatam, qua Deus per essentiam videtur.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The Godhead is united to the manhood of Christ in Person, not in essence or nature; yet with the unity of Person remains the distinction of natures. And therefore the soul of Christ, which is a part of human nature, through a light participated from the Divine Nature, is perfected with the beatific knowledge whereby it sees God in essence.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ex ipsa unione homo ille est beatus beatitudine increata, sicut ex unione est Deus. Sed praeter beatitudinem increatam, oportuit in natura humana Christi esse quandam beatitudinem creatam, per quam anima eius in ultimo fine humanae naturae constitueretur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 By the union this Man is blessed with the uncreated beatitude, even as by the union He is God; yet besides the uncreated beatitude it was necessary that there should be in the human nature of Christ a created beatitude, whereby His soul was established in the last end of human nature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod visio seu scientia beata est quodammodo supra naturam animae rationalis, inquantum scilicet propria virtute ad eam pervenire non potest. Alio vero modo est secundum naturam ipsius, inquantum scilicet per naturam suam est capax eius, prout scilicet ad imaginem Dei facta est, ut supra dictum est. Sed scientia increata est omnibus modis supra naturam animae humanae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The beatific vision and knowledge are to some extent above the nature of the rational soul, inasmuch as it cannot reach it of its own strength; but in another way it is in accordance with its nature, inasmuch as it is capable of it by nature, having been made to the likeness of God, as stated above. But the uncreated knowledge is in every way above the nature of the human soul.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod divinitas unita est humanitati Christi secundum personam, et non secundum naturam vel essentiam, sed cum unitate personae remanet distinctio naturarum. Et ideo anima Christi, quae est pars humanae naturae, per aliquod lumen participatum a natura divina perfecta est ad scientiam beatam, qua Deus per essentiam videtur.

Ad secundum dicendum quod ex ipsa unione homo ille est beatus beatitudine increata, sicut ex unione est Deus. Sed praeter beatitudinem increatam, oportuit in natura humana Christi esse quandam beatitudinem creatam, per quam anima eius in ultimo fine humanae naturae constitueretur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 By the union this Man is blessed with the uncreated beatitude, even as by the union He is God; yet besides the uncreated beatitude it was necessary that there should be in the human nature of Christ a created beatitude, whereby His soul was established in the last end of human nature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod visio seu scientia beata est quodammodo supra naturam animae rationalis, inquantum scilicet propria virtute ad eam pervenire non potest. Alio vero modo est secundum naturam ipsius, inquantum scilicet per naturam suam est capax eius, prout scilicet ad imaginem Dei facta est, ut supra dictum est. Sed scientia increata est omnibus modis supra naturam animae humanae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The beatific vision and knowledge are to some extent above the nature of the rational soul, inasmuch as it cannot reach it of its own strength; but in another way it is in accordance with its nature, inasmuch as it is capable of it by nature, having been made to the likeness of God, as stated above. But the uncreated knowledge is in every way above the nature of the human soul.

Praeterea, ei quod est plenum, non potest aliquid superaddi. Sed potentia animae Christi fuit impleta per species intelligibiles divinitus inditas, ut dictum est. Non ergo potuerunt supervenire eius animae aliquae species acquisitae.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, nothing can be added to what is full. But the power of Christ's soul was filled with intelligible species divinely infused, as was said above (A. 3). Therefore no acquired species could accrue to His soul.




Praeterea, in eo qui iam habitum scientiae habet, per ea quae a sensu accipit, non acquiritur novus habitus, quia sic duae formae eiusdem speciei simul essent in eodem, sed habitus qui prius inerat, confirmatur et augetur. Cum ergo Christus habuerit habitum scientiae inditae, non videtur quod per ea quae sensu percepit, aliquam aliam scientiam acquisierit.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, he who already has the habit of knowledge, acquires no new habit, through what he receives from the senses (otherwise two forms of the same species would be in the same thing together); but the habit which previously existed is strengthened and increased. Therefore, since Christ had the habit of infused knowledge, it does not seem that He acquired a new knowledge through what He perceived by the senses.




Sed contra est quod Heb. V dicitur, cum esset filius Dei, didicit ex his quae passus est, obedientiam, Glossa, idest, expertus est. Fuit ergo in Christo aliqua experimentalis scientia, quae est scientia acquisita.
        


On the contrary,
 It is written (
Heb. 5:8
): "Whereas... He was the Son of God, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered," i.e. "experienced," says a gloss. Therefore there was in the soul of Christ an empiric knowledge, which is acquired knowledge.




Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut ex supra dictis patet, nihil eorum quae Deus in nostra natura plantavit, defuit humanae naturae assumptae a verbo Dei. Manifestum est autem quod in humana natura Deus plantavit non solum intellectum possibilem, sed etiam intellectum agentem. Unde necesse est dicere quod in anima Christi non solum intellectus possibilis, sed etiam intellectus agens fuerit. Si autem in aliis Deus et natura nihil frustra fecerunt, ut philosophus dicit, in I de caelo et mundo, multo minus in anima Christi aliquid fuit frustra. Frustra autem est quod non habet propriam operationem, cum omnis res sit propter suam operationem, ut dicitur in II de caelo et mundo. Propria autem operatio intellectus agentis est facere species intelligibiles actu, abstrahendo eas a phantasmatibus, unde dicitur in III de anima quod intellectus agens est quo est omnia facere. Sic igitur necesse est dicere quod in Christo fuerunt aliquae species intelligibiles per actionem intellectus agentis in intellectu possibili eius receptae. Quod est esse in ipso scientiam acquisitam, quam quidam experimentalem nominant. Et ideo, quamvis aliter alibi scripserim, dicendum est in Christo scientiam acquisitam fuisse. Quae proprie est scientia secundum modum humanum, non solum ex parte recipientis subiecti, sed etiam ex parte causae agentis, nam talis scientia ponitur in Christo secundum lumen intellectus agentis, quod est humanae naturae connaturale. Scientia autem infusa attribuitur animae humanae secundum lumen desuper infusum, qui modus cognoscendi est proportionatus naturae angelicae. Scientia vero beata, per quam ipsa Dei essentia videtur, est propria et connaturalis soli Deo, ut in prima parte dictum est.
        


I answer that,
 As is plain from Article [1], nothing that God planted in our nature was wanting to the human nature assumed by the Word of God. Now it is manifest that God planted in human nature not only a passive, but an active intellect. Hence it is necessary to say that in the soul of Christ there was not merely a passive, but also an active intellect. But if in other things God and nature make nothing in vain, as the Philosopher says (De Coel. i, 31; ii, 59), still less in the soul of Christ is there anything in vain. Now what has not its proper operation is useless, as is said in De Coel. ii, 17. Now the proper operation of the active intellect is to make intelligible species in act, by abstracting them from phantasms; hence, it is said (De Anima iii, 18) that the active intellect is that "whereby everything is made actual." And thus it is necessary to say that in Christ there were intelligible species received in the passive intellect by the action of the active intellect---which means that there was acquired knowledge in Him, which some call empiric. And hence, although I wrote differently (Sent. iii, D, xiv, 
Article [3]
; D, xviii, 
Article [3]
), it must be said that in Christ there was acquired knowledge, which is properly knowledge in a human fashion, both as regards the subject receiving and as regards the active cause. For such knowledge springs from Christ's active intellect, which is natural to the human soul. But infused knowledge is attributed to the soul, on account of a light infused from on high, and this manner of knowing is proportioned to the angelic nature. But the beatific knowledge, whereby the very Essence of God is seen, is proper and natural to God alone, as was said in the FP, Question [12], Article [4].




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, cum duplex sit modus acquirendi scientiam, scilicet inveniendo et addiscendo, modus qui est per inventionem est praecipuus, modus autem qui est per disciplinam est secundarius. Unde dicitur in I Ethic., ille quidem est optimus qui omnia per seipsum intelligit, bonus autem et ille qui bene dicenti obediet. Et ideo Christo magis competebat habere scientiam acquisitam per inventionem quam per disciplinam, praesertim cum ipse daretur a Deo omnibus in doctorem, secundum illud Ioel II, laetamini in domino Deo vestro, quia dedit vobis doctorem iustitiae.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Since there is a twofold way of acquiring knowledge---by discovery and by being taught---the way of discovery is the higher, and the way of being taught is secondary. Hence it is said (Ethic. i, 4): "He indeed is the best who knows everything by himself: yet he is good who obeys him that speaks aright." And hence it was more fitting for Christ to possess a knowledge acquired by discovery than by being taught, especially since He was given to be the Teacher of all, according to Joel 2:23: "Be joyful in the Lord your God, because He hath given you a Teacher of justice."




Ad secundum dicendum quod humana mens duplicem habet respectum. Unum quidem ad superiora. Et secundum hunc respectum, anima Christi fuit plena per scientiam inditam. Alius autem respectus eius est ad inferiora, idest ad phantasmata, quae sunt nata movere mentem humanam per virtutem intellectus agentis. Oportuit autem quod etiam secundum hunc respectum anima Christi scientia impleretur, non quin prima plenitudo menti humanae sufficeret secundum seipsam; sed oportebat eam perfici etiam secundum comparationem ad phantasmata.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The human mind has two relations---one to higher things, and in this respect the soul of Christ was full of the infused knowledge. The other relation is to lower things, i.e. to phantasms, which naturally move the human mind by virtue of the active intellect. Now it was necessary that even in this respect the soul of Christ should be filled with knowledge, not that the first fulness was insufficient for the human mind in itself, but that it behooved it to be also perfected with regard to phantasms.




Ad tertium dicendum quod alia ratio est de habitu acquisito, et de habitu infuso. Nam habitus scientiae acquiritur per comparationem humanae mentis ad phantasmata, unde secundum eandem rationem non potest alius habitus iterato acquiri. Sed habitus scientiae infusae est alterius rationis, utpote a superiori descendens in animam, non secundum proportionem phantasmatum. Et ideo non est eadem ratio de utroque habitu.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Acquired and infused habits are not to be classed together; for the habit of knowledge is acquired by the relation of the human mind to phantasms; hence, another habit of the same kind cannot be again acquired. But the habit of infused knowledge is of a different nature, as coming down to the soul from on high, and not from phantasms. And hence there is no parity between these habits.

Praeterea, in eo qui iam habitum scientiae habet, per ea quae a sensu accipit, non acquiritur novus habitus, quia sic duae formae eiusdem speciei simul essent in eodem, sed habitus qui prius inerat, confirmatur et augetur.

), it must be said that in Christ there was acquired knowledge, which is properly knowledge in a human fashion, both as regards the subject receiving and as regards the active cause. For such knowledge springs from Christ's active intellect, which is natural to the human soul. But infused knowledge is attributed to the soul, on account of a light infused from on high, and this manner of knowing is proportioned to the angelic nature. But the beatific knowledge, whereby the very Essence of God is seen, is proper and natural to God alone, as was said in the FP, Question [12], Article [4].




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, cum duplex sit modus acquirendi scientiam, scilicet inveniendo et addiscendo, modus qui est per inventionem est praecipuus, modus autem qui est per disciplinam est secundarius. Unde dicitur in I Ethic., ille quidem est optimus qui omnia per seipsum intelligit, bonus autem et ille qui bene dicenti obediet. Et ideo Christo magis competebat habere scientiam acquisitam per inventionem quam per disciplinam, praesertim cum ipse daretur a Deo omnibus in doctorem, secundum illud Ioel II, laetamini in domino Deo vestro, quia dedit vobis doctorem iustitiae.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Since there is a twofold way of acquiring knowledge---by discovery and by being taught---the way of discovery is the higher, and the way of being taught is secondary. Hence it is said (Ethic. i, 4): "He indeed is the best who knows everything by himself: yet he is good who obeys him that speaks aright." And hence it was more fitting for Christ to possess a knowledge acquired by discovery than by being taught, especially since He was given to be the Teacher of all, according to Joel 2:23: "Be joyful in the Lord your God, because He hath given you a Teacher of justice."




Ad secundum dicendum quod humana mens duplicem habet respectum. Unum quidem ad superiora. Et secundum hunc respectum, anima Christi fuit plena per scientiam inditam. Alius autem respectus eius est ad inferiora, idest ad phantasmata, quae sunt nata movere mentem humanam per virtutem intellectus agentis. Oportuit autem quod etiam secundum hunc respectum anima Christi scientia impleretur, non quin prima plenitudo menti humanae sufficeret secundum seipsam; sed oportebat eam perfici etiam secundum comparationem ad phantasmata.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The human mind has two relations---one to higher things, and in this respect the soul of Christ was full of the infused knowledge. The other relation is to lower things, i.e. to phantasms, which naturally move the human mind by virtue of the active intellect. Now it was necessary that even in this respect the soul of Christ should be filled with knowledge, not that the first fulness was insufficient for the human mind in itself, but that it behooved it to be also perfected with regard to phantasms.




Ad tertium dicendum quod alia ratio est de habitu acquisito, et de habitu infuso. Nam habitus scientiae acquiritur per comparationem humanae mentis ad phantasmata, unde secundum eandem rationem non potest alius habitus iterato acquiri. Sed habitus scientiae infusae est alterius rationis, utpote a superiori descendens in animam, non secundum proportionem phantasmatum. Et ideo non est eadem ratio de utroque habitu.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Acquired and infused habits are not to be classed together; for the habit of knowledge is acquired by the relation of the human mind to phantasms; hence, another habit of the same kind cannot be again acquired. But the habit of infused knowledge is of a different nature, as coming down to the soul from on high, and not from phantasms. And hence there is no parity between these habits.
