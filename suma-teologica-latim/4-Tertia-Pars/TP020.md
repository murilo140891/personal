# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod relatio servitutis et dominii fundatur super actione et passione, inquantum scilicet servi est moveri a domino secundum imperium. Agere autem non attribuitur naturae sicut agenti, sed personae, actus enim suppositorum sunt et singularium, secundum philosophum. Attribuitur tamen actio naturae sicut ei secundum quam persona vel hypostasis agit. Et ideo, quamvis non proprie dicatur quod natura sit domina vel serva, potest tamen proprie dici quod aliqua hypostasis vel persona sit domina vel serva secundum hanc vel illam naturam. Et secundum hoc, nihil prohibet Christum dicere patri subiectum, vel servum, secundum humanam naturam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The relation of subservience and dominion is based upon action and passion, inasmuch as it belongs to a servant to be moved by the will of his master. Now to act is not attributed to the nature as agent, but to the person, since "acts belong to supposita and to singulars," according to the Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1). Nevertheless action is attributed to the nature as to that whereby the person or hypostasis acts. Hence, although the nature is not properly said to rule or serve, yet every hypostasis or person may be properly said to be ruling or serving in this or that nature. And in this way nothing prevents Christ being subject or servant to the Father in human nature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus dicit, in I de Trin., tunc Christus tradet regnum Deo et patri, quando iustos, in quibus nunc regnat per fidem, perducturus est ad speciem, ut scilicet videant ipsam essentiam communem patri et filio. Et tunc totaliter erit patri subiectus non solum in se, sed etiam in membris suis, per plenam participationem divinae bonitatis. Tunc etiam omnia erunt plene ei subiecta per finalem impletionem suae voluntatis de eis. Licet etiam modo sint omnia ei subiecta quantum ad potestatem, secundum illud Matth. ult., data est mihi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra, et cetera.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Augustine says (De Trin. i, 8): "Christ will give the kingdom to God and the Father, when He has brought the faithful, over whom He now reigns by faith, to the vision," i.e. to see the essence common to the Father and the Son: and then He will be totally subject to the Father not only in Himself, but also in His members by the full participation of the Godhead. And then all things will be fully subject to Him by the final accomplishment of His will concerning them; although even now all things are subject to Him as regards His power, according to Mt. 28:18: "All power is given to Me in heaven and in earth."
