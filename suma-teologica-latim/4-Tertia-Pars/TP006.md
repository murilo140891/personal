# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, si intellectus non sit aliud ab anima secundum essentiam, distinguitur tamen ab aliis partibus animae secundum rationem potentiae. Et secundum hoc competit sibi ratio medii.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although the intellect is not distinct from the soul in essence, it is distinct from the other parts of the soul as a power; and it is in this way that it has the nature of a medium.




Ad secundum dicendum quod spiritui angelico non deest congruitas ad assumptionem propter defectum dignitatis, sed propter irreparabilitatem casus. Quod non potest dici de spiritu humano, ut patet ex his quae in prima parte dicta sunt.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 Fitness for assumption is wanting to the angelic spirits, not from any lack of dignity, but because of the irremediableness of their fall, which cannot be said of the human spirit, as is clear from what has been said above (

Ad tertium dicendum quod anima inter quam et Dei verbum ponitur medium intellectus, non accipitur pro essentia animae, quae est omnibus potentiis communis, sed pro potentiis inferioribus, quae sunt omni animae communes.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The soul, between which and the Word of God the intellect is said to be a medium, does not stand for the essence of the soul, which is common to all the powers, but for the lower powers, which are common to every soul.
