# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod matrimonium fuit institutum in statu innocentiae, non secundum quod est sacramentum, sed secundum quod est in officium naturae. Ex consequenti tamen aliquid significabat futurum circa Christum et Ecclesiam, sicut et omnia alia in figura Christi praecesserunt.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Matrimony was instituted in the state of innocence, not as a sacrament, but as a function of nature. Consequently, however, it foreshadowed something in relation to Christ and the Church: just as everything else foreshadowed Christ.
