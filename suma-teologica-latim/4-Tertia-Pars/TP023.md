# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod bona spiritualia possunt simul a pluribus possideri, non autem bona corporalia. Et ideo hereditatem corporalem nullus potest percipere nisi succedens decedenti, hereditatem autem spiritualem simul omnes ex integro percipiunt, sine detrimento patris semper viventis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Spiritual goods can be possessed by many at the same time; not so material goods. Wherefore none can receive a material inheritance except the successor of a deceased person: whereas all receive the spiritual inheritance at the same time in its entirety without detriment to the ever-living Father.




Quamvis posset dici quod Deus decedit secundum quod est in nobis per fidem, ut incipiat in nobis esse per speciem, sicut Glossa dicit, Rom. VIII, super illud, si filii, et heredes.
        
Yet it might be said that God ceases to be, according as He is in us by faith, so as to begin to be in us by vision, as a gloss says on Rm. 8:17: "If sons, heirs also."

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut filiatio non proprie convenit naturae, ita nec adoptio. Et ideo, cum dicitur quod carnis humanitas adoptatur, impropria est locutio, et accipitur ibi adoptio pro unione humanae naturae ad personam filii.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 As sonship does not properly belong to the nature, so neither does adoption. Consequently, when it is said that "carnal humanity is adopted," the expression is metaphorical: and adoption is used to signify the union of human nature to the Person of the Son.




Ad secundum dicendum quod similitudo illa Augustini est intelligenda quantum ad principium, quia scilicet, sicut sine meritis habet quilibet homo ut sit Christianus, ita ille homo sine meritis habuit ut esset Christus. Est tamen differentia quantum ad terminum, quia scilicet Christus per gratiam unionis est filius naturalis; alius autem per gratiam habitualem est filius adoptivus. Gratia autem habitualis in Christo non facit de nonfilio filium adoptivum, sed est quidam effectus filiationis in anima Christi, secundum illud Ioan. I, vidimus gloriam eius quasi unigeniti a patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This comparison of Augustine is to be referred to the principle because, to wit, just as it is granted to any man without meriting it to be a Christian, so did it happen that this man without meriting it was Christ. But there is a difference on the part of the term: because by the grace of union Christ is the natural Son; whereas another man by habitual grace is an adopted son. Yet habitual grace in Christ does not make one who was not a son to be an adopted son, but is a certain effect of Filiation in the soul of Christ, according to Jn. 1:14: "We saw His glory... as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father; full of grace and truth."




Ad tertium dicendum quod esse creaturam, et etiam servitus vel subiectio ad Deum, non solum respicit personam, sed etiam naturam, quod non potest dici de filiatione. Et ideo non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 To be a creature, as also to be subservient or subject to God, regards not only the person, but also the nature: but this cannot be said of sonship. Wherefore the comparison does not hold.
