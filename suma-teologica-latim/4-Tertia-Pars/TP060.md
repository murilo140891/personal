# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, quia medicina se habet ut causa effectiva sanitatis, inde est quod omnia denominata a medicina dicuntur per ordinem ad unum primum agens, et per hoc, medicamentum importat causalitatem quandam. Sed sanctitas, a qua denominatur sacramentum, non significatur per modum causae efficientis, sed magis per modum causae formalis vel finalis. Et ideo non oportet quod sacramentum semper importet causalitatem.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Because medicine is an efficient cause of health, consequently whatever things are denominated from medicine are to be referred to some first active cause: so that a medicament implies a certain causality. But sanctity from which a sacrament is denominated, is not there taken as an efficient cause, but rather as a formal or a final cause. Therefore it does not follow that a sacrament need always imply causality.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit secundum quod sacramentum idem est quod sacrum secretum. Dicitur autem non solum Dei secretum, sed etiam regis, esse sacrum et sacramentum. Quia secundum antiquos sancta vel sacrosancta dicebantur quaecumque violari non licebat, sicut etiam muri civitatis, et personae in dignitatibus constitutae. Et ideo illa secreta, sive divina sive humana, quae non licet violari quibuslibet publicando, dicuntur sacra vel sacramenta.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This argument considers sacrament in the sense of a "sacred secret." Now not only God's but also the king's, secret, is said to be sacred and to be a sacrament: because according to the ancients, whatever it was unlawful to lay violent hands on was said to be holy or sacrosanct, such as the city walls, and persons of high rank. Consequently those secrets, whether Divine or human, which it is unlawful to violate by making them known to anybody whatever, are called "sacred secrets or sacraments."




Ad tertium dicendum quod etiam iuramentum habet quandam habitudinem ad res sacras, inquantum scilicet est quaedam contestatio facta per aliquod sacrum. Et secundum hoc dicitur esse sacramentum, non eadem ratione qua nunc loquimur de sacramentis; non tamen aequivoce sumpto nomine sacramenti, sed analogice, scilicet secundum diversam habitudinem ad aliquid unum, quod est res sacra.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Even an oath has a certain relation to sacred things, in so far as it consists in calling a sacred thing to witness. And in this sense it is called a sacrament: not in the sense in which we speak of sacraments now; the word "sacrament" being thus used not equivocally but analogically, i.e. by reason of a different relation to the one thing, viz. something sacred.

Praeterea, omnia quae in veteri lege fiebant, Christum figurabant, qui est sanctus sanctorum, secundum illud I Cor. X, omnia in figura contingebant illis, et Coloss. II, quae sunt umbra futurorum, corpus autem Christi. Nec tamen omnia gesta patrum veteris testamenti, vel etiam omnes caeremoniae legis, sunt sacramenta, sed quaedam specialiter, sicut in secunda parte habitum est. Ergo videtur quod non omne signum sacrae rei sit sacramentum.
        


Objection 2:
 Further, whatever was done under the Old Law was a figure of Christ Who is the "Holy of Holies" (
Dan. 9:24
), according to 1 Cor. 10:11: "All (these) things happened to them in figure"; and Col. 2:17: "Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's." And yet not all that was done by the Fathers of the Old Testament, not even all the ceremonies of the Law, were sacraments, but only in certain special cases, as stated in the FS, Question [101], Article [4]. Therefore it seems that not every sign of a sacred thing is a sacrament.




Praeterea, etiam in novo testamento multa geruntur in signum alicuius rei sacrae, quae tamen non dicuntur sacramenta, sicut aspersio aquae benedictae, consecratio altaris, et consimilia. Non ergo omne signum rei sacrae est sacramentum.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, even in the New Testament many things are done in sign of some sacred thing; yet they are not called sacraments; such as sprinkling with holy water, the consecration of an altar, and such like. Therefore not every sign of a sacred thing is a sacrament.




Sed contra est quod definitio convertitur cum definito. Sed quidam definiunt sacramentum per hoc quod est sacrae rei signum, et hoc etiam videtur ex auctoritate Augustini supra inducta. Ergo videtur quod omne signum rei sacrae sit sacramentum.
        


On the contrary,
 A definition is convertible with the thing defined. Now some define a sacrament as being "the sign of a sacred thing"; moreover, this is clear from the passage quoted above (
Article [1]
) from Augustine. Therefore it seems that every sign of a sacred thing is a sacrament.




Respondeo dicendum quod signa dantur hominibus, quorum est per nota ad ignota pervenire. Et ideo proprie dicitur sacramentum quod est signum alicuius rei sacrae ad homines pertinentis, ut scilicet proprie dicatur sacramentum, secundum quod nunc de sacramentis loquimur, quod est signum rei sacrae inquantum est sanctificans homines.
        
I answer that,
 Signs are given to men, to whom it is proper to discover the unknown by means of the known. Consequently a sacrament properly so called is that which is the sign of some sacred thing pertaining to man; so that properly speaking a sacrament, as considered by us now, is defined as being the "sign of a holy thing so far as it makes men holy."




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod creaturae sensibiles significant aliquid sacrum, scilicet sapientiam et bonitatem divinam, inquantum sunt in seipsis sacra, non autem inquantum nos per ea sanctificamur. Et ideo non possunt dici sacramenta secundum quod nunc loquimur de sacramentis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Sensible creatures signify something holy, viz. Divine wisdom and goodness inasmuch as these are holy in themselves; but not inasmuch as we are made holy by them. Therefore they cannot be called sacraments as we understand sacraments now.




Ad secundum dicendum quod quaedam ad vetus testamentum pertinentia significabant sanctitatem Christi secundum quod in se sanctus est. Quaedam vero significabant sanctitatem eius inquantum per eam nos sanctificamur, sicut immolatio agni paschalis significabat immolationem Christi, qua sanctificati sumus. Et talia dicuntur proprie veteris legis sacramenta.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Some things pertaining to the Old Testament signified the holiness of Christ considered as holy in Himself. Others signified His holiness considered as the cause of our holiness; thus the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb signified Christ's Sacrifice whereby we are made holy: and such like are properly styled sacraments of the Old Law.




Ad tertium dicendum quod res denominantur a fine et complemento. Dispositio autem non est finis, sed perfectio. Et ideo ea quae significant dispositionem ad sanctitatem, non dicuntur sacramenta, de quibus procedit obiectio; sed solum ea quae significant perfectionem sanctitatis humanae.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Names are given to things considered in reference to their end and state of completeness. Now a disposition is not an end, whereas perfection is. Consequently things that signify disposition to holiness are not called sacraments, and with regard to these the objection is verified: only those are called sacraments which signify the perfection of holiness in man.

 Sensible things considered in their own nature do not belong to the worship or kingdom of God: but considered only as signs of spiritual things in which the kingdom of God consists.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Augustinus ibi loquitur de rebus sensibilibus secundum quod in sua natura considerantur, non autem secundum quod assumuntur ad significandum spiritualia, quae sunt maxima bona.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Augustine speaks there of sensible things, considered in their nature; but not as employed to signify spiritual things, which are the highest goods.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod res visibiles sacramentorum dicuntur verba per similitudinem quandam, inquantum scilicet participant quandam vim significandi, quae principaliter est in ipsis verbis, ut dictum est. Et ideo non est superflua ingeminatio verborum cum in sacramentis rebus visibilibus verba adduntur, quia unum eorum determinatur per aliud, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The sensible elements of the sacraments are called words by way of a certain likeness, in so far as they partake of a certain significative power, which resides principally in the very words, as stated above. Consequently it is not a superfluous repetition to add words to the visible element in the sacraments; because one determines the other, as stated above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, quamvis verba et aliae res sensibiles sint in diverso genere quantum pertinet ad naturam rei, conveniunt tamen ratione significandi. Quae perfectius est in verbis quam in aliis rebus. Et ideo ex verbis et rebus fit quodammodo unum in sacramentis sicut ex forma et materia, inquantum scilicet per verba perficitur significatio rerum, ut dictum est. Sub rebus autem comprehenduntur etiam ipsi actus sensibiles, puta ablutio et unctio et alia huiusmodi, quia in his est eadem ratio significandi et in rebus.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although words and other sensible things are not in the same genus, considered in their natures, yet have they something in common as to the thing signified by them: which is more perfectly done in words than in other things. Wherefore in the sacraments, words and things, like form and matter, combine in the formation of one thing, in so far as the signification of things is completed by means of words, as above stated. And under words are comprised also sensible actions, such as cleansing and anointing and such like: because they have a like signification with the things.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus dicit, contra Faustum, alia debent esse sacramenta rei praesentis, et alia rei futurae. Sacramenta autem veteris legis praenuntia erant Christi venturi. Et ideo non ita expresse significabant Christum sicut sacramenta novae legis, quae ab ipso Christo effluunt, et quandam similitudinem ipsius in se habent, ut dictum est. Utebantur tamen in veteri lege aliquibus verbis in his quae ad cultum Dei pertinent, tam sacerdotes, qui erant sacramentorum illorum ministri, secundum illud Num. VI, sic benedicetis filiis Israel, et dicetis eis, benedicat tibi dominus, etc.; quam etiam illi qui illis sacramentis utebantur, secundum illud Deut. XXVI, profiteor hodie coram domino Deo tuo, et cetera.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix), the sacraments of things present should be different from sacraments of things to come. Now the sacraments of the Old Law foretold the coming of Christ. Consequently they did not signify Christ so clearly as the sacraments of the New Law, which flow from Christ Himself, and have a certain likeness to Him, as stated above. Nevertheless in the Old Law, certain words were used in things pertaining to the worship of God, both by the priests, who were the ministers of those sacraments, according to Num. 6:23,24: "Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, and you shall say to them: The Lord bless thee," etc.; and by those who made use of those sacraments, according to Dt. 26:3: "I profess this day before the Lord thy God," etc.

Ad tertium dicendum quod, si sit tanta interruptio verborum quod intercipiatur intentio pronuntiantis, tollitur sensus sacramenti, et per consequens veritas eius. Non autem tollitur quando est parva interruptio proferentis, quae intentionem et intellectum non aufert.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 If the words are interrupted to such an extent that the intention of the speaker is interrupted, the sacramental sense is destroyed, and consequently, the validity of the sacrament. But this is not the case if the interruption of the speaker is so slight, that his intention and the sense of the words is not interrupted.




Et idem etiam dicendum est de transpositione verborum. Quia, si tollit sensum locutionis, non perficitur sacramentum, sicut patet de negatione praeposita vel postposita signo. Si autem sit talis transpositio quae sensum locutionis non variat, non tollitur veritas sacramenti, secundum quod philosophus dicit quod nomina et verba transposita idem significant.
        
The same is to be said of a change in the order of the words. Because if this destroys the sense of the words, the sacrament is invalidated: as happens when a negation is made to precede or follow a word. But if the order is so changed that the sense of the words does not vary, the sacrament is not invalidated, according to the Philosopher's dictum: "Nouns and verbs mean the same though they be transposed" (Peri Herm. x).

Et idem etiam dicendum est de transpositione verborum. Quia, si tollit sensum locutionis, non perficitur sacramentum, sicut patet de negatione praeposita vel postposita signo.

Because if this destroys the sense of the words, the sacrament is invalidated: as happens when a negation is made to precede or follow a word. But if the order is so changed that the sense of the words does not vary, the sacrament is not invalidated, according to the Philosopher's dictum: "Nouns and verbs mean the same though they be transposed" (Peri Herm. x).
