# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod sensus spiritualis gratiae non pervenit quidem ad corpus primo et principaliter, sed secundario et instrumentaliter, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The spiritual sense of grace does not reach to the body first and principally, but secondarily and instrumentally, as was said above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod corpus animalis bruti nullam habitudinem habet ad animam rationalem, sicut habet corpus humanum. Et ideo non est simile.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The body of an animal has no relation to a rational soul, as the human body has. Hence there is no parity.
      


Ad tertium dicendum quod, licet Christus traxerit materiam corporis ab aliis hominibus, vitam tamen immortalem corporis omnes homines trahunt ab ipso, secundum illud I Cor. XV, sicut in Adam omnes moriuntur, ita in Christo omnes vivificabuntur.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although Christ drew the matter of His body from other men, yet all draw from Him the immortal life of their body, according to 1 Cor. 15:22: "And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive."

Ad tertium dicendum quod sancti patres non insistebant sacramentis legalibus tanquam quibusdam rebus, sed sicut imaginibus et umbris futurorum. Idem autem est motus in imaginem, inquantum est imago, et in rem, ut patet per philosophum, in libro de memoria et reminiscentia. Et ideo antiqui patres, servando legalia sacramenta, ferebantur in Christum per fidem et dilectionem eandem qua et nos in ipsum ferimur. Et ita patres antiqui pertinebant ad idem corpus Ecclesiae ad quod nos pertinemus.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The holy Fathers made use of the legal sacraments, not as realities, but as images and shadows of what was to come. Now it is the same motion to an image as image, and to the reality, as is clear from the Philosopher (De Memor. et Remin. ii). Hence the ancient Fathers, by observing the legal sacraments, were borne to Christ by the same faith and love whereby we also are borne to Him, and hence the ancient Fathers belong to the same Church as we.

Ad tertium dicendum quod omnia peccata conveniunt in aversione a Deo, licet ad invicem differant secundum conversionem ad diversa commutabilia bona.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 All sins agree in aversion from God, although they differ by conversion to different changeable goods.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Diabolus et Antichristus non sunt duo capita, sed unum, quia Antichristus dicitur esse caput inquantum plenissime invenitur in eo impressa malitia Diaboli. Unde super illud II Thess. II, ostendens se tanquam sit Deus, dicit Glossa, in ipso erit caput omnium malorum, scilicet Diabolus, qui est rex super omnes filios superbiae. Non autem dicitur in eo esse per unionem personalem; nec per intrinsecam habitationem, quia sola Trinitas menti illabitur, ut dicitur in libro de ecclesiasticis dogmatibus, sed per malitiae effectum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The devil and Anti-christ are not two heads, but one; since Anti-christ is called the head, inasmuch as the wickedness of the devil is most fully impressed on him. Hence, on 2 Thess. 2:4, "Showing himself as if he were God," a gloss says: "The head of all the wicked, namely the devil, who is king over all the children of pride will be in him." Now he is said to be in him not by personal union, nor by indwelling, since "the Trinity alone dwells in the mind" (as is said De Eccles. Dogm. lxxxiii), but by the effect of wickedness.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut caput Christi est Deus, et tamen ipse est caput Ecclesiae, ut supra dictum est; ita Antichristus est membrum Diaboli, et tamen ipse est caput malorum.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 As the head of Christ is God, and yet He is the Head of the Church, as was said above (
Article [1]
, ad 2), so likewise Anti-christ is a member of the devil and yet is head of the wicked.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Antichristus non dicitur caput omnium malorum propter similitudinem influentiae, sed propter similitudinem perfectionis. In eo enim Diabolus quasi malitiam suam ducet ad caput, per modum quo dicitur aliquis ad caput propositum suum ducere, cum illud perfecerit.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Anti-christ is said to be the head of all the wicked not by a likeness of influence, but by a likeness of perfection. For in him the devil, as it were, brings his wickedness to a head, in the same way that anyone is said to bring his purpose to a head when he executes it.

Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut caput Christi est Deus, et tamen ipse est caput Ecclesiae, ut supra dictum est; ita Antichristus est membrum Diaboli, et tamen ipse est caput malorum.
