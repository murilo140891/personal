# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod a Christo excluditur consilium quod est cum dubitatione, et per consequens electio, quae in sui ratione tale consilium includit. Non autem a Christo excluditur usus consiliandi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 From Christ is excluded that counsel which is with doubt; and consequently choice, which essentially includes such counsel; but the practice of using counsel is not excluded from Christ.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de discursu et collatione prout ordinatur ad scientiam acquirendam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This reason rests upon discursion and comparison, as used to acquire knowledge.




Ad tertium dicendum quod beati conformantur Angelis quantum ad dona gratiarum, manet tamen differentia quae est secundum naturam. Et ideo uti collatione et discursu est connaturale animabus beatorum, non autem Angelis.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The blessed are likened to the angels in the gifts of graces; yet there still remains the difference of natures. And hence to use comparison and discursion is connatural to the souls of the blessed, but not to angels.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod in anima Christi fuit duplex cognitio, et utraque suo modo perfectissima. Una quidem excedens modum naturae humanae, qua scilicet vidit Dei essentiam et alia in ipsa. Et haec fuit perfectissima simpliciter. Et talis cognitio non fuit habitualis, sed actualis respectu omnium quae hoc modo cognovit. Alia autem cognitio fuit in Christo secundum modum proportionatum humanae naturae, prout scilicet cognovit res per species sibi divinitus inditas, de qua cognitione nunc loquimur. Et haec cognitio non fuit simpliciter perfectissima, sed perfectissima in genere humanae cognitionis. Unde non oportuit quod semper esset in actu.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 In Christ's soul there was a twofold knowledge---each most perfect of its kind: the first exceeding the mode of human nature, as by it He saw the Essence of God, and other things in It, and this was the most perfect, simply. Nor was this knowledge habitual, but actual with respect to everything He knew in this way. But the second knowledge was in Christ in a manner proportioned to human nature, i.e. inasmuch as He knew things by species divinely imprinted upon Him, and of this knowledge we are now speaking. Now this knowledge was not most perfect, simply, but merely in the genus of human knowledge; hence it did not behoove it to be always in act.




Ad secundum dicendum quod habitus reducitur in actum ad imperium voluntatis, nam habitus est quo quis agit cum voluerit. Voluntas autem se habet ad infinita indeterminate. Et tamen hoc non est frustra, licet non in omnia actualiter tendat, dummodo tendat actualiter in id quod convenit loco et tempori. Et ideo etiam habitus non est frustra, licet non omnia reducantur in actum quae habitui subiacent, dummodo reducatur in actum id quod congruit ad debitum finem voluntatis secundum exigentiam negotiorum et temporis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Habits are reduced to act by the command of the will, since a habit is that "with which we act when we wish." Now the will is indeterminate in regard to infinite things. Yet it is not useless, even when it does not actually tend to all; provided it actually tends to everything in fitting place and time. And hence neither is a habit useless, even if all that it extends to is not reduced to act; provided that that which befits the due end of the will be reduced to act according as the matter in hand and the time require.




Ad tertium dicendum quod bonum et ens dupliciter dicitur. Uno modo, simpliciter. Et sic bonum et ens dicitur substantia, quae in suo esse et in sua bonitate subsistit. Alio modo dicitur ens et bonum secundum quid. Et hoc modo dicitur ens accidens, non quia ipsum habeat esse et bonitatem, sed quia eo subiectum est ens et bonum. Sic igitur scientia habitualis non est simpliciter melior aut dignior quam anima Christi, sed secundum quid, nam tota bonitas habitualis scientiae cedit in bonitatem subiecti.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Goodness and being are taken in two ways: First, simply; and thus a substance, which subsists in its being and goodness, is a good and a being; secondly, being and goodness are taken relatively, and in this way an accident is a being and a good, not that it has being and goodness, but that its subject is a being and a good. And hence habitual knowledge is not simply better or more excellent than the soul of Christ; but relatively, since the whole goodness of habitual knowledge is added to the goodness of the subject.
