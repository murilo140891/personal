# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, licet carnes animalium occisorum expresse repraesentent Christi passionem, tamen minus competunt ad communem usum huius sacramenti, et ad ecclesiasticam unitatem significandam.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Although the flesh of slaughtered animals represents the Passion more forcibly, nevertheless it is less suitable for the common use of this sacrament, and for denoting the unity of the Church.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, licet non in omnibus terris nascatur triticum et vinum, tamen de facili ad omnes terras deferri potest quantum sufficit ad usum huius sacramenti. Nec propter defectum alterius, est unum tantum sine altero consecrandum, quia non esset perfectum sacrificium.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although wheat and wine are not produced in every country, yet they can easily be conveyed to every land, that is, as much as is needful for the use of this sacrament: at the same time one is not to be consecrated when the other is lacking, because it would not be a complete sacrament.




Ad tertium dicendum quod vinum in modica quantitate sumptum non potest aegrotanti multum nocere. Et tamen, si nocumentum timeatur, non est necesse quod omnes accipientes corpus Christi, etiam sanguinem accipiant, ut infra dicetur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Wine taken in small quantity cannot do the sick much harm: yet if there be fear of harm, it is not necessary for all who take Christ's body to partake also of His blood, as will be stated later (

Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismi sacramentum perficitur in usu materiae. Et ideo per formam Baptismi non plus de aqua sanctificatur quam quantum venit in usum. Sed hoc sacramentum perficitur in consecratione materiae. Et ideo non est simile.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The sacrament of Baptism is perfected in the use of the matter: and therefore no more of the water is hallowed than what is used. But this sacrament is wrought in the consecration of the matter. Consequently there is no parallel.

Ad quartum dicendum quod aliquando est tanta corruptio panis quod solvitur species panis, sicut cum continuitas solvitur, et sapor et color et alia accidentia mutantur. Unde ex tali materia non potest confici corpus Christi. Aliquando vero non est tanta corruptio quae speciem solvat, sed est aliqua dispositio ad corruptionem, quod declarat aliqualis immutatio saporis. Et ex tali pane potest confici corpus Christi, sed peccat conficiens, propter irreverentiam sacramenti. Et quia amidum est ex tritico corrupto, non videtur quod panis ex eo confectus possit fieri corpus Christi, quamvis quidam contrarium dicant.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Sometimes there is such corruption of the bread that the species of bread is lost, as when the continuity of its parts is destroyed, and the taste, color, and other accidents are changed; hence the body of Christ may not be made from such matter. But sometimes there is not such corruption as to alter the species, but merely disposition towards corruption, which a slight change in the savor betrays, and from such bread the body of Christ may be made: but he who does so, sins from irreverence towards the sacrament. And because starch comes of corrupted wheat, it does not seem as if the body of Christ could be made of the bread made therefrom, although some hold the contrary.
