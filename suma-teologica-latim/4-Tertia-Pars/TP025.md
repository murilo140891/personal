# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod in Trinitate sunt tres qui honorantur, sed una est causa honoris. In mysterio autem incarnationis est e converso. Et ideo alio modo est unus honor Trinitatis, et alio modo est unus honor Christi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 In the Trinity there are three Who are honored, but only one cause of honor. In the mystery of the Incarnation it is the reverse: and therefore only one honor is given to the Trinity and only one to Christ, but in a different way.




Ad secundum dicendum quod operatio non est quae honoratur, sed est ratio honoris. Et ideo per hoc quod in Christo sunt duae operationes, non ostenditur quod sint duae adorationes, sed quod sint duae adorationis causae.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Operation is not the object but the motive of honor. And therefore there being two operations in Christ proves, not two adorations, but two causes of adoration.




Ad tertium dicendum quod anima Christi, si non esset unita Dei verbo esset id quod est principalissimum in homine illo. Et ideo sibi praecipue deberetur honor, quia homo est quod est potissimum in eo. Sed quia anima Christi est unita personae digniori, illi personae praecipue debetur honor cui anima Christi unitur. Nec per hoc tamen diminuitur dignitas animae Christi, sed augetur ut supra dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 If the soul of Christ were not united to the Word of God, it would be the principal thing in that Man. Wherefore honor would be due to it principally, since man is that which is principal in him [*Cf. Ethic. ix, 8]. But since Christ's soul is united to a Person of greater dignity, to that Person is honor principally due to Whom Christ's soul is united. Nor is the dignity of Christ's soul hereby diminished, but rather increased, as stated above (

Ad secundum dicendum quod honor matris refertur ad filium, quia ipsa mater est propter filium honoranda. Non tamen eo modo quo honor imaginis refertur ad exemplar, quia ipsa imago, prout in se consideratur ut res quaedam, nullo modo est veneranda.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The honor given to the Mother reflects on her Son, because the Mother is to be honored for her Son's sake. But not in the same way as honor given to an image reflects on its exemplar: because the image itself, considered as a thing, is not to be venerated in any way at all.




Ad tertium dicendum quod crux, prout ipsa in se consideratur, ut dictum est, non est capax honoris. Sed beata virgo est secundum seipsam capax venerationis. Et ideo non est similis ratio.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The cross, considered in itself, is not an object of veneration, as stated above (
Articles [4]
,5). But the Blessed Virgin is in herself an object of veneration. Hence there is no comparison.
