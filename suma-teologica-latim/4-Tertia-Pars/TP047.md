# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus simul et violentiam passus est, ut moreretur, et tamen voluntarie mortuus fuit, quia violentia corpori eius illata est, quae tamen tantum corpori eius praevaluit quantum ipse voluit.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ at the same time suffered violence in order to die, and died, nevertheless, voluntarily; because violence was inflicted on His body, which, however, prevailed over His body only so far as He willed it.

Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus voluit quidem suam passionem, sicut et Deus eam voluit, iniquam tamen actionem Iudaeorum noluit. Et ideo occisores Christi ab iniustitia non excusantur. Et tamen ille qui occidit hominem, iniuriam facit non solum homini, sed etiam Deo et reipublicae, sicut etiam et ille qui occidit seipsum, ut philosophus dicit, in V Ethic. Unde David damnavit illum ad mortem qui non timuerat mittere manum ut occideret Christum domini, quamvis eo petente, ut legitur II Reg. I.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ, indeed willed His Passion just as the Father willed it; yet He did not will the unjust action of the Jews. Consequently Christ's slayers are not excused of their injustice. Nevertheless, whoever slays a man not only does a wrong to the one slain, but likewise to God and to the State; just as he who kills himself, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. v). Hence it was that David condemned to death the man who "did not fear to lay hands upon the Lord's anointed," even though he (Saul) had requested it, as related 2 Kgs. 1:5-14.
