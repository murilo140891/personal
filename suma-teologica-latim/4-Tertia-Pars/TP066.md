# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, opinionem Hugonis de sancto Victore in hac parte sequi non oportet. Potest tamen verificari ut Baptismus dicatur aqua esse, quia aqua est materiale Baptismi principium. Et sic erit praedicatio per causam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 As already stated, the opinion of Hugh of St. Victor on this question is not to be followed. Nevertheless the saying that "Baptism is water" may be verified in so far as water is the material principle of Baptism: and thus there would be "causal predication."




Ad tertium dicendum quod, accedente verbo ad elementum fit sacramentum, non quidem in ipso elemento, sed in homine, cui adhibetur elementum per usum ablutionis. Et hoc etiam significat ipsum verbum quod accedit ad elementum, cum dicitur, ego te baptizo, et cetera.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 When the words are added, the element becomes a sacrament, not in the element itself, but in man, to whom the element is applied, by being used in washing him. Indeed, this is signified by those very words which are added to the element, when we say: "I baptize thee," etc.

Ad tertium dicendum quod ex latere Christi fluxit aqua ad abluendum, sanguis autem ad redimendum. Et ideo sanguis competit sacramento Eucharistiae, aqua autem sacramento Baptismi. Qui tamen habet vim ablutivam ex virtute sanguinis Christi.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Water flowed from Christ's side to wash us; blood, to redeem us. Wherefore blood belongs to the sacrament of the Eucharist, while water belongs to the sacrament of Baptism. Yet this latter sacrament derives its cleansing virtue from the power of Christ's blood.




Ad quartum dicendum quod virtus Christi derivata est ad omnem aquam, non propter continuitatem loci, sed propter similitudinem speciei, ut dicit Augustinus, in quodam sermone Epiphaniae, quae de salvatoris Baptismate benedictio fluxit, tanquam fluvius spiritalis, omnium gurgitum tractus, universorum fontium venas implevit.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Christ's power flowed into all waters, by reason of, not connection of place, but likeness of species, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Append. Serm. cxxxv): "The blessing that flowed from the Saviour's Baptism, like a mystic river, swelled the course of every stream, and filled the channels of every spring."




Ad quintum dicendum quod illa benedictio quae adhibetur aquae, non est de necessitate Baptismi, sed pertinet ad quandam solemnitatem, per quam excitatur devotio fidelium, et impeditur astutia Daemonis, ne impediat Baptismi effectum.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 The blessing of the water is not essential to Baptism, but belongs to a certain solemnity, whereby the devotion of the faithful is aroused, and the cunning of the devil hindered from impeding the baptismal effect.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod alia duo Baptismata includuntur in Baptismo aquae, qui efficaciam habet et ex passione Christi et ex spiritu sancto. Et ideo per hoc non tollitur unitas Baptismatis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The other two Baptisms are included in the Baptism of Water, which derives its efficacy, both from Christ's Passion and from the Holy Ghost. Consequently for this reason the unity of Baptism is not destroyed.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, sacramentum habet rationem signi. Alia vero duo conveniunt cum Baptismo aquae, non quidem quantum ad rationem signi, sed quantum ad effectum Baptismatis. Et ideo non sunt sacramenta.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 As stated above (
Question [60]
, 
Article [1]
), a sacrament is a kind of sign. The other two, however, are like the Baptism of Water, not, indeed, in the nature of sign, but in the baptismal effect. Consequently they are not sacraments.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Damascenus ponit quaedam Baptismata figuralia. Sicut diluvium, quod fuit signum nostri Baptismi quantum ad salvationem fidelium in Ecclesia, sicut tunc paucae animae salvae factae sunt in arca, ut dicitur I Petr. III. Ponit etiam transitum maris rubri, qui significat nostrum Baptisma quantum ad liberationem a servitute peccati; unde apostolus dicit, I Cor. X, quod omnes baptizati sunt in nube et in mari. Ponit etiam ablutiones diversas quae fiebant in veteri lege, praefigurantes nostrum Baptisma quantum ad purgationem peccatorum. Ponit etiam Baptismum Ioannis, qui fuit praeparatorius ad nostrum Baptisma.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Damascene enumerates certain figurative Baptisms. For instance, "the Deluge" was a figure of our Baptism, in respect of the salvation of the faithful in the Church; since then "a few... souls were saved in the ark [Vulg.: 'by water']," according to 1 Pt. 3:20. He also mentions "the crossing of the Red Sea": which was a figure of our Baptism, in respect of our delivery from the bondage of sin; hence the Apostle says (
1 Cor. 10:2
) that "all... were baptized in the cloud and in the sea." And again he mentions "the various washings which were customary under the Old Law," which were figures of our Baptism, as to the cleansing from sins: also "the Baptism of John," which prepared the way for our Baptism.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod character est res et sacramentum. Non autem dicimus quod Baptismus sanguinis praeeminentiam habeat secundum rationem sacramenti, sed quantum ad sacramenti effectum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 A character is both reality and a sacrament. And we do not say that the Baptism of Blood is more excellent, considering the nature of a sacrament; but considering the sacramental effect.
      


Ad secundum dicendum quod effusio sanguinis non habet rationem Baptismi si sit sine caritate. Ex quo patet quod Baptismus sanguinis includit Baptismum flaminis, et non e converso. Unde ex hoc probatur perfectior.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The shedding of blood is not in the nature of a Baptism if it be without charity. Hence it is clear that the Baptism of Blood includes the Baptism of the Spirit, but not conversely. And from this it is proved to be more perfect.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismus sanguinis praeeminentiam habet non solum ex parte passionis Christi, sed etiam ex parte spiritus sancti, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The Baptism owes its pre-eminence not only to Christ's Passion, but also to the Holy Ghost, as stated above.
