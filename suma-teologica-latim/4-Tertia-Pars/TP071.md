# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod per ea quae aguntur in exorcismo non tollitur culpa, propter quam homo punitur post mortem, sed solum tolluntur impedimenta recipiendi remissionem culpae per sacramentum. Unde post mortem exorcismus non valet sine Baptismo.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 What is done in the exorcism does not take away the sin for which man is punished after death; but only the impediments against his receiving the remission of sin through the sacrament. Wherefore exorcism avails a man nothing after death if he has not been baptized.




Praepositinus autem dicit quod pueri exorcizati, si moriantur ante Baptismum, minores tenebras patientur. Sed hoc non videtur verum, quia tenebrae illae sunt carentia divinae visionis, quae non recipit magis et minus.
        
Praepositivus, however, says that children who die after being exorcized but before being baptized are subjected to lesser darkness. But this does not seem to be true: because that darkness consists in privation of the vision of God, which cannot be greater or lesser.




Ad secundum dicendum quod de ratione sacramenti est quod perficiat principalem effectum, qui est gratia remittens culpam, vel supplens aliquem hominis defectum. Quod quidem non fit per ea quae aguntur in exorcismo, sed solum huiusmodi impedimenta tolluntur. Et ideo non sunt sacramenta, sed sacramentalia quaedam.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 It is essential to a sacrament to produce its principal effect, which is grace that remits sin, or supplies some defect in man. But those things that are done in the exorcism do not effect this; they merely remove these impediments. Consequently, they are not sacraments but sacramentals.




Ad tertium dicendum quod dispositio sufficiens ad suscipiendam gratiam baptismalem est fides et intentio, vel propria eius qui baptizatur, si sit adultus, vel Ecclesiae, si sit parvulus. Ea vero quae aguntur in exorcismo, ordinantur ad removendum impedimenta. Et ideo sine eis potest aliquis consequi effectum Baptismi.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The disposition that suffices for receiving the baptismal grace is the faith and intention, either of the one baptized, if it be an adult, or of the Church, if it be a child. But these things that are done in the exorcism, are directed to the removal of the impediments. And therefore one may receive the effect of Baptism without them.




Non tamen sunt huiusmodi praetermittenda, nisi in necessitatis articulo. Et tunc, cessante periculo, debent suppleri, ut servetur uniformitas in Baptismo. Nec frustra supplentur post Baptismum, quia, sicut impeditur effectus Baptismi antequam percipiatur, ita potest impediri postquam fuerit perceptus.
        
Yet they are not to be omitted save in a case of necessity. And then, if the danger pass, they should be supplied, that uniformity in Baptism may be observed. Nor are they supplied to no purpose after Baptism: because, just as the effect of Baptism may be hindered before it is received, so can it be hindered after it has been received.




Ad quartum dicendum quod eorum quae aguntur post Baptismum circa baptizatum, aliquid est quod non solum significat, sed efficit, puta inunctio quae fit in vertice, quae operatur conservationem gratiae baptismalis. Aliquid autem est quod nihil efficit, sed solum significat, sicut quod datur eis vestis candida, ad significandam novitatem vitae.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Of those things that are done after Baptism in respect of the person baptized, something is done which is not a mere sign, but produces an effect, for instance, the anointing on the top of the head, the effect of which is the preservation of baptismal grace. And there is something which has no effect, but is a mere sign, for instance, the baptized are given a white garment to signify the newness of life.
