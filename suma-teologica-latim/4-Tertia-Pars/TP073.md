Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ex eisdem nutrimur ex quibus sumus, non tamen eodem modo nobis advenientibus. Nam ea ex quibus sumus, nobis adveniunt per generationem, eadem autem, inquantum ex eis nutrimur, nobis adveniunt per manducationem. Unde et, sicut per Baptismum regeneramur in Christo, ita per Eucharistiam manducamus Christum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 We are nourished from the same things of which we are made, but they do not come to us in the same way; for those out of which we are made come to us through generation, while the same, as nourishing us, come to us through being eaten. Hence, as we are new-born in Christ through Baptism, so through the Eucharist we eat Christ.




Ad secundum dicendum quod Eucharistia est sacramentum perfectum dominicae passionis, tanquam continens ipsum Christum passum. Et ideo non potuit institui ante incarnationem, sed tunc habebant locum sacramenta quae erant tantum praefigurativa dominicae passionis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The Eucharist is the perfect sacrament of our Lord's Passion, as containing Christ crucified; consequently it could not be instituted before the Incarnation; but then there was room for only such sacraments as were prefigurative of the Lord's Passion.




Ad tertium dicendum quod sacramentum illud fuit institutum in cena ut in futurum esset memoriale dominicae passionis, ea perfecta. Unde signanter dicit, haec quotiescumque feceritis, de futuro loquens.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This sacrament was instituted during the supper, so as in the future to be a memorial of our Lord's Passion as accomplished. Hence He said expressively: "As often as ye shall do these things" [*Cf. Canon of the Mass], speaking of the future.




Ad quartum dicendum quod institutio respondet ordini intentionis. Sacramentum autem Eucharistiae, quamvis sit posterius Baptismo in perceptione, est tamen prius in intentione. Et ideo debuit prius institui. Vel potest dici quod Baptismus iam erat institutus in ipso Christi Baptismo. Unde et iam aliqui ipso Christi Baptismo erant baptizati, ut legitur Ioan. III.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 The institution responds to the order of intention. But the sacrament of the Eucharist, although after Baptism in the receiving, is yet previous to it in intention; and therefore it behooved to be instituted first. or else it can be said that Baptism was already instituted in Christ's Baptism; hence some were already baptized with Christ's Baptism, as we read in Jn. 3:22.

Ad sextum sic proceditur. Videtur quod agnus paschalis non fuerit praecipua figura huius sacramenti. Christus enim dicitur sacerdos secundum ordinem Melchisedech, propter hoc quod Melchisedech gessit figuram sacrificii Christi, offerens panem et vinum. Sed expressio similitudinis facit quod unum ab alio denominetur. Ergo videtur quod oblatio Melchisedech fuerit potissima figura huius sacramenti.
        


Objection 1:
 It seems that the Paschal Lamb was not the chief figure of this sacrament, because (
Ps. 109:4
) Christ is called "a priest according to the order of Melchisedech," since Melchisedech bore the figure of Christ's sacrifice, in offering bread and wine. But the expression of likeness causes one thing to be named from another. Therefore, it seems that Melchisedech's offering was the "principal" figure of this sacrament.




Praeterea, transitus maris rubri fuit figura Baptismi, secundum illud I Cor. X, omnes baptizati sunt in nube et in mari. Sed immolatio agni paschalis praecessit transitum maris rubri, quem subsecutum est manna, sicut Eucharistia sequitur Baptismum. Ergo manna est expressior figura huius sacramenti quam agnus paschalis.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, the passage of the Red Sea was a figure of Baptism, according to 1 Cor. 10:2: "All... were baptized in the cloud and in the sea." But the immolation of the Paschal Lamb was previous to the passage of the Red Sea, and the Manna came after it, just as the Eucharist follows Baptism. Therefore the Manna is a more expressive figure of this sacrament than the Paschal Lamb.




Praeterea, potissima virtus huius sacramenti est quod introducit nos in regnum caelorum, sicut quoddam viaticum. Sed hoc maxime figuratum fuit in sacramento expiationis, quando pontifex intrabat semel in anno cum sanguine in sancta sanctorum, sicut apostolus probat, Heb. IX. Ergo videtur quod illud sacrificium fuerit expressior figura huius sacramenti quam agnus paschalis.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, the principal power of this sacrament is that it brings us into the kingdom of heaven, being a kind of "viaticum." But this was chiefly prefigured in the sacrament of expiation when the "high-priest entered once a year into the Holy of Holies with blood," as the Apostle proves in Heb. 9. Consequently, it seems that that sacrifice was a more significant figure of this sacrament than was the Paschal Lamb.




Sed contra est quod apostolus dicit, I Cor. V, Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus. Itaque epulemur in azymis sinceritatis et veritatis.
        


On the contrary,
 The Apostle says (
1 Cor. 5:7,8
): "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed; therefore let us feast... with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."




Respondeo dicendum quod in hoc sacramento tria considerare possumus, scilicet id quod est sacramentum tantum, scilicet panis et vinum; et id quod est res et sacramentum, scilicet corpus Christi verum; et id quod est res tantum, scilicet effectus huius sacramenti. Quantum igitur ad id quod est sacramentum tantum potissima figura fuit huius sacramenti oblatio Melchisedech, qui obtulit panem et vinum. Quantum autem ad ipsum Christum passum, qui continetur in hoc sacramento, figurae eius fuerunt omnia sacrificia veteris testamenti; et praecipue sacrificium expiationis, quod erat solemnissimum. Quantum autem ad effectum, fuit praecipua eius figura manna, quod habebat in se omnis saporis suavitatem, ut dicitur Sap. XVI, sicut et gratia huius sacramenti quantum ad omnia reficit mentem.
        
I answer that,
 We can consider three things in this sacrament: namely, that which is sacrament only, and this is the bread and wine; that which is both reality and sacrament, to wit, Christ's true body; and lastly that which is reality only, namely, the effect of this sacrament. Consequently, in relation to what is sacrament only, the chief figure of this sacrament was the oblation of Melchisedech, who offered up bread and wine. In relation to Christ crucified, Who is contained in this sacrament, its figures were all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, especially the sacrifice of expiation, which was the most solemn of all. While with regard to its effect, the chief figure was the Manna, "having in it the sweetness of every taste" (Wis. 16:20), just as the grace of this sacrament refreshes the soul in all respects.




Sed agnus paschalis quantum ad haec tria praefigurabat hoc sacramentum. Quantum enim ad primum, quia manducabatur cum panibus azymis, secundum illud Exod. XII, edent carnes et azymos panes. Quantum vero ad secundum, quia immolabatur ab omni multitudine filiorum Israel quartadecima luna, quod fuit figura passionis Christi, qui propter innocentiam dicitur agnus. Quantum vero ad effectum, quia per sanguinem agni paschalis protecti sunt filii Israel a devastante Angelo, et educti de Aegyptiaca servitute. Et quantum ad hoc, ponitur figura huius sacramenti praecipua agnus paschalis, quia secundum omnia eam repraesentat.
        
The Paschal Lamb foreshadowed this sacrament in these three ways. First of all, because it was eaten with unleavened loaves, according to Ex. 12:8: "They shall eat flesh... and unleavened bread." As to the second because it was immolated by the entire multitude of the children of Israel on the fourteenth day of the moon; and this was a figure of the Passion of Christ, Who is called the Lamb on account of His innocence. As to the effect, because by the blood of the Paschal Lamb the children of Israel were preserved from the destroying Angel, and brought from the Egyptian captivity; and in this respect the Paschal Lamb is the chief figure of this sacrament, because it represents it in every respect.




Et per hoc patet responsio ad obiecta.
