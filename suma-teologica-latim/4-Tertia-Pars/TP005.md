# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, ubi est ipsa res per sui praesentiam non requiritur eius imago ad hoc quod suppleat locum rei, sicut, ubi erat imperator, milites non venerabantur eius imaginem. Sed tamen requiritur cum praesentia rei imago ipsius ut perficiatur ex ipsa rei praesentia, sicut imago in cera perficitur per impressionem sigilli, et imago hominis resultat in speculo per eius praesentiam. Unde, ad perficiendam humanam mentem, necessarium fuit quod eam sibi verbum Dei univit.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Where a thing is by its presence, its image is not required to supply the place of the thing, as where the emperor is the soldiers do not pay homage to his image. Yet the image of a thing is required together with its presence, that it may be perfected by the presence of the thing, just as the image in the wax is perfected by the impression of the seal, and as the image of man is reflected in the mirror by his presence. Hence in order to perfect the human mind it was necessary that the Word should unite it to Himself.




Ad secundum dicendum quod lux maior evacuat lucem minorem alterius corporis illuminantis, non tamen evacuat, sed perficit lucem corporis illuminati. Ad praesentiam enim solis stellarum lux obscuratur, sed aeris lumen perficitur. Intellectus autem seu mens hominis est quasi lux illuminata a luce divini verbi. Et ideo per lucem divini verbi non evacuatur mens hominis, sed magis perficitur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The greater light dims the lesser light of another luminous body; but it does not dim, rather it perfects the light of the body illuminated---at the presence of the sun the light of the stars is put out, but the light of the air is perfected. Now the intellect or mind of man is, as it were, a light lit up by the light of the Divine Word; and hence by the presence of the Word the mind of man is perfected rather than overshadowed.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, licet potentia intellectiva non sit alicuius corporis actus, ipsa tamen essentia animae humanae, quae est forma corporis, requiritur quod sit nobilior, ad hoc quod habeat potentiam intelligendi. Et ideo necesse est ut corpus melius dispositum ei respondeat.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although the intellective power is not the act of a body, nevertheless the essence of the human soul, which is the form of the body, requires that it should be more noble, in order that it may have the power of understanding; and hence it is necessary that a better disposed body should correspond to it.
