# Summa Theologica

Ad quintum dicendum quod aliud est proprium operatum operationis divinae, et operationis humanae in Christo, sicut operatum proprium divinae operationis est sanatio leprosi, operatum autem proprium humanae naturae est eius contactus. Concurrunt tamen ambae operationes ad unum operatum secundum quod una natura agit cum communione alterius, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 The proper work of the Divine operation is different from the proper work of the human operation. Thus to heal a leper is a proper work of the Divine operation, but to touch him is the proper work of the human operation. Now both these operations concur in one work, inasmuch as one nature acts in union with the other.
