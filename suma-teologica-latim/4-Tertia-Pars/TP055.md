# Summa Theologica

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod apostoli potuerunt testificari Christi resurrectionem etiam de visu, quia Christum post resurrectionem viventem oculata fide viderunt, quem mortuum sciverant. Sed sicut ad visionem beatam pervenitur per auditum fidei, ita ad visionem Christi resurgentis pervenerunt homines per ea quae prius ab Angelis audierunt.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The apostles were able to testify to the Resurrection even by sight, because from the testimony of their own eyes they saw Christ alive, whom they had known to be dead. But just as man comes from the hearing of faith to the beatific vision, so did men come to the sight of the risen Christ through the message already received from angels.




Ad secundum dicendum quod ascensio Christi, quantum ad terminum a quo, non transcendebat hominum communem notitiam, sed solum quantum ad terminum ad quem. Et ideo discipuli potuerunt videre ascensionem Christi quantum ad terminum a quo, idest secundum quod elevabatur a terra. Non autem viderunt ipsam quantum ad terminum ad quem, quia non viderunt quomodo reciperetur in caelo. Sed resurrectio Christi transcendebat communem notitiam et quantum ad terminum a quo, secundum quod anima rediit ab Inferis et corpus de sepulcro clauso exivit; et quantum ad terminum ad quem, secundum quod est adeptus vitam gloriosam. Et ideo non debuit resurrectio fieri sic quod ab homine videretur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ's Ascension as to its term wherefrom, was not above men's common knowledge, but only as to its term whereunto. Consequently, the disciples were able to behold Christ's Ascension as to the term wherefrom, that is, according as He was uplifted from the earth; but they did not behold Him as to the term whereunto, because they did not see how He was received into heaven. But Christ's Resurrection transcended common knowledge as to the term wherefrom, according as His soul returned from hell and His body from the closed sepulchre; and likewise as to the term whereunto, according as He attained to the life of glory. Consequently, the Resurrection ought not to be accomplished so as to be seen by man.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Lazarus resuscitatus est ut rediret ad vitam qualem prius habuerat, quae communem notitiam hominum non transcendit. Et ideo non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Lazarus was raised so that he returned to the same life as before, which life is not beyond man's common ken. Consequently, there is no parity.
