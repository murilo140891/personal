# Summa Theologica

Hoc autem conveniens est, primo quidem, perfectioni novae legis. Sacrificia enim veteris legis illud verum sacrificium passionis Christi continebant solum in figura, secundum illud Heb. X, umbram habens lex futurorum bonorum, non ipsam rerum imaginem. Et ideo oportuit ut aliquid plus haberet sacrificium novae legis a Christo institutum, ut scilicet contineret ipsum passum, non solum in significatione vel figura, sed etiam in rei veritate. Et ideo hoc sacramentum, quod ipsum Christum realiter continet, ut Dionysius dicit, III cap. Eccles. Hierar., est perfectivum omnium sacramentorum aliorum, in quibus virtus Christi participatur.
        
Now this is suitable, first for the perfection of the New Law. For, the sacrifices of the Old Law contained only in figure that true sacrifice of Christ's Passion, according to Heb. 10:1: "For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things." And therefore it was necessary that the sacrifice of the New Law instituted by Christ should have something more, namely, that it should contain Christ Himself crucified, not merely in signification or figure, but also in very truth. And therefore this sacrament which contains Christ Himself, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), is perfective of all the other sacraments, in which Christ's virtue is participated.




Secundo, hoc competit caritati Christi, ex qua pro salute nostra corpus verum nostrae naturae assumpsit. Et quia maxime proprium amicitiae est, convivere amicis, ut philosophus dicit, IX Ethic., sui praesentiam corporalem nobis repromittit in praemium, Matth. XXIV, ubi fuerit corpus, illuc congregabuntur et aquilae. Interim tamen nec sua praesentia corporali in hac peregrinatione destituit, sed per veritatem corporis et sanguinis sui nos sibi coniungit in hoc sacramento. Unde ipse dicit, Ioan. VI, qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet et ego in eo. Unde hoc sacramentum est maximae caritatis signum, et nostrae spei sublevamentum, ex tam familiari coniunctione Christi ad nos.
        

          Secondly, this belongs to Christ's love, out of which for our salvation He assumed a true body of our nature. And because it is the special feature of friendship to live together with friends, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix), He promises us His bodily presence as a reward, saying (
Mt. 24:28
): "Where the body is, there shall the eagles be gathered together." Yet meanwhile in our pilgrimage He does not deprive us of His bodily presence; but unites us with Himself in this sacrament through the truth of His body and blood. Hence (
Jn. 6:57
) he says: "He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him." Hence this sacrament is the sign of supreme charity, and the uplifter of our hope, from such familiar union of Christ with us.




Tertio, hoc competit perfectioni fidei, quae, sicut est de divinitate Christi, ita est de eius humanitate, secundum illud Ioan. XIV, creditis in Deum, et in me credite. Et quia fides est invisibilium, sicut divinitatem suam nobis exhibet Christus invisibiliter, ita et in hoc sacramento carnem suam nobis exhibet invisibili modo.
        
Thirdly, it belongs to the perfection of faith, which concerns His humanity just as it does His Godhead, according to Jn. 14:1: "You believe in God, believe also in Me." And since faith is of things unseen, as Christ shows us His Godhead invisibly, so also in this sacrament He shows us His flesh in an invisible manner.




Quae quidam non attendentes, posuerunt corpus et sanguinem Christi non esse in hoc sacramento nisi sicut in signo. Quod est tanquam haereticum abiiciendum, utpote verbis Christi contrarium. Unde et Berengarius, qui primus inventor huius erroris fuerat, postea coactus est suum errorem revocare, et veritatem fidei confiteri.
        
Some men accordingly, not paying heed to these things, have contended that Christ's body and blood are not in this sacrament except as in a sign, a thing to be rejected as heretical, since it is contrary to Christ's words. Hence Berengarius, who had been the first deviser of this heresy, was afterwards forced to withdraw his error, and to acknowledge the truth of the faith.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ex hac auctoritate praedicti haeretici occasionem errandi sumpserunt, male verba Augustini intelligentes. Cum enim Augustinus dicit, non hoc corpus quod videtis manducaturi estis, non intendit excludere veritatem corporis Christi, sed quod non erat manducandum in hac specie in qua ab eis videbatur. Per hoc autem quod subdit, sacramentum vobis aliquod commendavi, spiritualiter intellectum vivificabit vos, non intendit quod corpus Christi sit in hoc sacramento solum secundum mysticam significationem, sed spiritualiter dici, idest, invisibiliter et per virtutem spiritus. Unde, super Ioan., exponens illud quod dicitur, caro non prodest quidquam, dicit, sed, quo modo illi intellexerunt. Carnem quippe sic intellexerunt manducandam, quo modo in cadavere dilaniatur aut in macello venditur, non quo modo spiritu vegetatur. Accedat spiritus ad carnem, et prodest plurimum, nam, si caro nihil prodesset, verbum caro non fieret, ut habitaret in nobis.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 From this authority the aforesaid heretics have taken occasion to err from evilly understanding Augustine's words. For when Augustine says: "You are not to eat this body which you see," he means not to exclude the truth of Christ's body, but that it was not to be eaten in this species in which it was seen by them. And by the words: "It is a mystery that I put before you; in its spiritual sense it will quicken you," he intends not that the body of Christ is in this sacrament merely according to mystical signification, but "spiritually," that is, invisibly, and by the power of the spirit. Hence (Tract. xxvii), expounding Jn. 6:64: "the flesh profiteth nothing," he says: "Yea, but as they understood it, for they understood that the flesh was to be eaten as it is divided piecemeal in a dead body, or as sold in the shambles, not as it is quickened by the spirit... Let the spirit draw nigh to the flesh... then the flesh profiteth very much: for if the flesh profiteth nothing, the Word had not been made flesh, that It might dwell among us."




Ad secundum dicendum quod verbum illud Augustini, et omnia similia, sunt intelligenda de corpore Christi secundum quod videtur in propria specie, secundum quod etiam ipse dominus dixit, Matth. XXVI, me autem non semper habebitis. Invisibiliter tamen sub speciebus huius sacramenti est ubicumque hoc sacramentum perficitur.
        


Reply to Objection 2:
 That saying of Augustine and all others like it are to be understood of Christ's body as it is beheld in its proper species; according as our Lord Himself says (
Mt. 26:11
): "But Me you have not always." Nevertheless He is invisibly under the species of this sacrament, wherever this sacrament is performed.




Ad tertium dicendum quod corpus Christi non est eo modo in sacramento sicut corpus in loco, quod suis dimensionibus loco commensuratur, sed quodam speciali modo, qui est proprius huic sacramento. Unde dicimus quod corpus Christi est in diversis altaribus, non sicut in diversis locis, sed sicut in sacramento. Per quod non intelligimus quod Christus sit ibi solum sicut in signo, licet sacramentum sit in genere signi, sed intelligimus corpus Christi esse ibi, sicut dictum est, secundum modum proprium huic sacramento.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ's body is not in this sacrament in the same way as a body is in a place, which by its dimensions is commensurate with the place; but in a special manner which is proper to this sacrament. Hence we say that Christ's body is upon many altars, not as in different places, but "sacramentally": and thereby we do not understand that Christ is there only as in a sign, although a sacrament is a kind of sign; but that Christ's body is here after a fashion proper to this sacrament, as stated above.




Ad quartum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de praesentia corporis Christi prout est praesens per modum corporis, idest prout est in sua specie visibili, non autem prout spiritualiter, idest invisibiliter, modo et virtute spiritus. Unde Augustinus dicit, super Ioan., si intellexisti spiritualiter verba Christi de carne sua, spiritus et vita tibi sunt, si intellexisti carnaliter, etiam spiritus et vita sunt, sed tibi non sunt.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 This argument holds good of Christ's bodily presence, as He is present after the manner of a body, that is, as it is in its visible appearance, but not as it is spiritually, that is, invisibly, after the manner and by the virtue of the spirit. Hence Augustine (Tract. xxvii in Joan.) says: "If thou hast understood" Christ's words spiritually concerning His flesh, "they are spirit and life to thee; if thou hast understood them carnally, they are also spirit and life, but not to thee."

Secundo, quia haec positio contrariatur formae huius sacramenti, in qua dicitur, hoc est corpus meum. Quod non esset verum si substantia panis ibi remaneret, nunquam enim substantia panis est corpus Christi. Sed potius esset dicendum, hic est corpus meum.
        
Secondly, because this position is contrary to the form of this sacrament, in which it is said: "This is My body," which would not be true if the substance of the bread were to remain there; for the substance of bread never is the body of Christ. Rather should one say in that case: "Here is My body."




Tertio, quia contrariaretur venerationi huius sacramenti, si aliqua substantia esset ibi quae non posset adorari adoratione latriae.
        
Thirdly, because it would be opposed to the veneration of this sacrament, if any substance were there, which could not be adored with adoration of latria.




Quarto, quia contrariaretur ritui Ecclesiae, secundum quem post corporalem cibum non licet sumere corpus Christi, cum tamen post unam hostiam consecratam liceat sumere aliam. Unde haec positio vitanda est tanquam haeretica.
        
Fourthly, because it is contrary to the rite of the Church, according to which it is not lawful to take the body of Christ after bodily food, while it is nevertheless lawful to take one consecrated host after another. Hence this opinion is to be avoided as heretical.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Deus coniugavit divinitatem suam, idest divinam virtutem, pani et vino, non ut remaneant in hoc sacramento, sed ut faciat inde corpus et sanguinem suum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 God "wedded His Godhead," i.e. His Divine power, to the bread and wine, not that these may remain in this sacrament, but in order that He may make from them His body and blood.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in aliis sacramentis non est ipse Christus realiter, sicut in hoc sacramento. Et ideo in sacramentis aliis manet substantia materiae, non autem in isto.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ is not really present in the other sacraments, as in this; and therefore the substance of the matter remains in the other sacraments, but not in this.




Ad tertium dicendum quod species quae remanent in hoc sacramento, ut infra dicetur, sufficiunt ad significationem huius sacramenti, nam per accidentia cognoscitur ratio substantiae.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The species which remain in this sacrament, as shall be said later (
Article [5]
), suffice for its signification; because the nature of the substance is known by its accidents.

Tertio, quia contrariaretur venerationi huius sacramenti, si aliqua substantia esset ibi quae non posset adorari adoratione latriae.
        
Thirdly, because it would be opposed to the veneration of this sacrament, if any substance were there, which could not be adored with adoration of latria.




Quarto, quia contrariaretur ritui Ecclesiae, secundum quem post corporalem cibum non licet sumere corpus Christi, cum tamen post unam hostiam consecratam liceat sumere aliam. Unde haec positio vitanda est tanquam haeretica.
        
Fourthly, because it is contrary to the rite of the Church, according to which it is not lawful to take the body of Christ after bodily food, while it is nevertheless lawful to take one consecrated host after another. Hence this opinion is to be avoided as heretical.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Deus coniugavit divinitatem suam, idest divinam virtutem, pani et vino, non ut remaneant in hoc sacramento, sed ut faciat inde corpus et sanguinem suum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 God "wedded His Godhead," i.e. His Divine power, to the bread and wine, not that these may remain in this sacrament, but in order that He may make from them His body and blood.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in aliis sacramentis non est ipse Christus realiter, sicut in hoc sacramento. Et ideo in sacramentis aliis manet substantia materiae, non autem in isto.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Christ is not really present in the other sacraments, as in this; and therefore the substance of the matter remains in the other sacraments, but not in this.




Ad tertium dicendum quod species quae remanent in hoc sacramento, ut infra dicetur, sufficiunt ad significationem huius sacramenti, nam per accidentia cognoscitur ratio substantiae.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The species which remain in this sacrament, as shall be said later (
Article [5]
), suffice for its signification; because the nature of the substance is known by its accidents.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod substantia panis vel vini, facta consecratione, neque sub speciebus sacramenti manet, neque alibi. Non tamen sequitur quod annihiletur, convertitur enim in corpus Christi. Sicut non sequitur, si aer ex quo generatus est ignis, non sit ibi vel alibi, quod sit annihilatus.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The substance of the bread or wine, after the consecration, remains neither under the sacramental species, nor elsewhere; yet it does not follow that it is annihilated; for it is changed into the body of Christ; just as if the air, from which fire is generated, be not there or elsewhere, it does not follow that it is annihilated.




Ad secundum dicendum quod forma quae est terminus a quo, non convertitur in aliam formam, sed una forma succedit alteri in subiecto, et ideo prima forma non remanet nisi in potentia materiae. Sed hic substantia panis convertitur in corpus Christi, ut supra dictum est. Unde ratio non sequitur.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The form, which is the term "wherefrom," is not changed into another form; but one form succeeds another in the subject; and therefore the first form remains only in the potentiality of matter. But here the substance of the bread is changed into the body of Christ, as stated above. Hence the conclusion does not follow.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, licet post consecrationem haec sit falsa substantia panis est aliquid; id tamen in quod substantia panis conversa est, est aliquid. Et ideo substantia panis non est annihilata.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although after the consecration this proposition is false: "The substance of the breed is something," still that into which the substance of the bread is changed, is something, and consequently the substance of the bread is not annihilated.

Ad quartum dicendum quod haec conversio non proprie habet subiectum, ut dictum est. Sed tamen accidentia, quae remanent, habent aliquam similitudinem subiecti.
        


Reply to Objection 4:
 This change has not properly a subject, as was stated above (
Article [4]
, ad 1); nevertheless the accidents which remain have some resemblance of a subject.

Rursus, quia huius conversionis non est accipere aliquod subiectum, ea quae verificantur in conversione naturali ratione subiecti, non sunt concedenda in hac conversione. Et primo quidem, manifestum est quod potentia ad oppositum consequitur subiectum, ratione cuius dicimus quod album potest esse nigrum, vel aer potest esse ignis. Licet haec non sit ita propria sicut prima, nam subiectum albi, in quo est potentia ad nigredinem, est tota substantia albi, non enim albedo est pars eius; subiectum autem formae aeris est pars eius; unde, cum dicitur, aer potest esse ignis, verificatur ratione partis per synecdochen. Sed in hac conversione et similiter in creatione, quia nullum est subiectum, non dicitur quod unum extremum possit esse aliud, sicut quod non ens possit esse ens, vel quod panis possit esse corpus Christi. Et eadem ratione non potest proprie dici quod de non ente fiat ens, vel quod de pane fiat corpus Christi, quia haec praepositio de designat causam consubstantialem; quae quidem consubstantialitas extremorum in transmutationibus naturalibus attenditur penes convenientiam in subiecto. Et simili ratione non conceditur quod panis erit corpus Christi, vel quod fiat corpus Christi, sicut neque conceditur in creatione quod non ens erit ens, vel quod non ens fiat ens, quia hic modus loquendi verificatur in transmutationibus naturalibus ratione subiecti, puta cum dicimus quod album fit nigrum, vel album erit nigrum.
        
Again, since there is no subject of this conversion, the things which are true in natural conversion by reason of the subject, are not to be granted in this conversion. And in the first place indeed it is evident that potentiality to the opposite follows a subject, by reason whereof we say that "a white thing can be black," or that "air can be fire"; although the latter is not so proper as the former: for the subject of whiteness, in which there is potentiality to blackness, is the whole substance of the white thing; since whiteness is not a part thereof; whereas the subject of the form of air is part thereof: hence when it is said, "Air can be fire," it is verified by synecdoche by reason of the part. But in this conversion, and similarly in creation, because there is no subject, it is not said that one extreme can be the other, as that "non-being can be being," or that "bread can be the body of Christ": and for the same reason it cannot be properly said that "being is made of [de] non-being," or that "the body of Christ is made of bread," because this preposition "of" [de] denotes a consubstantial cause, which consubstantiality of the extremes in natural transmutations is considered according to something common in the subject. And for the same reason it is not granted that "bread will be the body of Christ," or that it "may become the body of Christ," just as it is not granted in creation that "non-being will be being," or that "non-being may become being," because this manner of speaking is verified in natural transmutations by reason of the subject: for instance, when we say that "a white thing becomes black," or "a white thing will be black."




Quia tamen in hoc sacramento, facta conversione, aliquid idem manet, scilicet accidentia panis, ut supra dictum est, secundum quandam similitudinem aliquae harum locutionum possunt concedi, scilicet quod panis sit corpus Christi, vel, panis erit corpus Christi, vel, de pane fit corpus Christi; ut nomine panis non intelligatur substantia panis, sed in universali hoc quod sub speciebus panis continetur, sub quibus prius continetur substantia panis, et postea corpus Christi.
        

          Nevertheless, since in this sacrament, after the change, something remains the same, namely, the accidents of the bread, as stated above (
Article [5]
), some of these expressions may be admitted by way of similitude, namely, that "bread is the body of Christ," or, "bread will be the body of Christ," or "the body of Christ is made of bread"; provided that by the word "bread" is not understood the substance of bread, but in general "that which is contained under the species of bread," under which species there is first contained the substance of bread, and afterwards the body of Christ.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod illud ex quo aliquid fit, quandoque quidem importat simul subiectum cum uno extremorum transmutationis, sicut cum dicitur, ex albo fit nigrum. Quandoque vero importat solum oppositum, vel extremum, sicut cum dicitur, ex mane fit dies. Et sic non conceditur quod hoc fiat illud, idest quod mane fiat dies. Et ita etiam in proposito, licet proprie dicatur quod ex pane fiat corpus Christi, non tamen proprie dicitur quod panis fiat corpus Christi, nisi secundum quandam similitudinem, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 That out of which something else is made, sometimes implies together with the subject, one of the extremes of the transmutation, as when it is said "a black thing is made out of a white one"; but sometimes it implies only the opposite or the extreme, as when it is said---"out of morning comes the day." And so it is not granted that the latter becomes the former, that is, "that morning becomes the day." So likewise in the matter in hand, although it may be said properly that "the body of Christ is made out of bread," yet it is not said properly that "bread becomes the body of Christ," except by similitude, as was said above.
      


Ad secundum dicendum quod illud ex quo fit aliquid, quandoque erit illud, propter subiectum quod importatur. Et ideo, cum huius conversionis non sit aliquod subiectum, non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 That out of which another is made, will sometimes be that other because of the subject which is implied. And therefore, since there is no subject of this change, the comparison does not hold.




Ad tertium dicendum quod in hac conversione sunt plura difficilia quam in creatione, in qua hoc solum difficile est, quod aliquid fit ex nihilo, quod tamen pertinet ad proprium modum productionis primae causae, quae nihil aliud praesupponit. Sed in hac conversione non solum est difficile quod hoc totum convertitur in illud totum, ita quod nihil prioris remaneat, quod non pertinet ad communem modum productionis alicuius causae, sed etiam habet hoc difficile, quod accidentia remanent corrupta substantia, et multa alia, de quibus in sequentibus agetur. Tamen verbum conversionis recipitur in hoc sacramento, non autem in creatione, sicut dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 In this change there are many more difficulties than in creation, in which there is but this one difficulty, that something is made out of nothing; yet this belongs to the proper mode of production of the first cause, which presupposes nothing else. But in this conversion not only is it difficult for this whole to be changed into that whole, so that nothing of the former may remain (which does not belong to the common mode of production of a cause), but furthermore it has this difficulty that the accidents remain while the substance is destroyed, and many other difficulties of which we shall treat hereafter (
Question [77]
). Nevertheless the word "conversion" is admitted in this sacrament, but not in creation, as stated above.




Ad quartum dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, potentia pertinet ad subiectum, quod non est accipere in hac conversione. Et ideo non conceditur quod panis possit esse corpus Christi, non enim haec conversio fit per potentiam passivam creaturae, sed per solam potentiam activam creatoris.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 As was observed above, potentiality belongs to the subject, whereas there is no subject in this conversion. And therefore it is not granted that bread can be the body of Christ: for this conversion does not come about by the passive potentiality of the creature, but solely by the active power of the Creator.
