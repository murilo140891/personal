# Summa Theologica

Quarto ut, ad poenitentiam homines inducens, homines praepararet ad digne suscipiendum Baptismum Christi. Unde Beda dicit quod, quantum catechumenis nondum baptizatis prodest doctrina fidei, tantum profuit Baptisma Ioannis ante Baptisma Christi. Quia sicut ille praedicabat poenitentiam, et Baptismum Christi praenuntiabat, et in cognitionem veritatis quae mundo apparuit attrahebat; sic ministri Ecclesiae, qui primo erudiunt, postea peccata eorum redarguunt, deinde in Baptismo Christi remissionem promittunt.
        
Fourthly, that by persuading men to do penance, he might prepare men to receive worthily the baptism of Christ. Wherefore Bede [*Cf. Scot. Erig. in Joan. iii, 24] says that "the baptism of John was as profitable before the baptism of Christ, as instruction in the faith profits the catechumens not yet baptized. For just as he preached penance, and foretold the baptism of Christ, and drew men to the knowledge of the Truth that hath appeared to the world, so do the ministers of the Church, after instructing men, chide them for their sins, and lastly promise them forgiveness in the baptism of Christ."




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Baptismus Ioannis non erat per se sacramentum, sed quasi quoddam sacramentale, disponens ad Baptismum Christi. Et ideo aliqualiter pertinebat ad legem Christi, non autem ad legem Moysi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The baptism of John was not a sacrament properly so called [per se], but a kind of sacramental, preparatory to the baptism of Christ. Consequently, in a way, it belonged to the law of Christ, but not to the law of Moses.




Ad secundum dicendum quod Ioannes non fuit solum propheta, sed plus quam propheta, ut dicitur Matth. XI, fuit enim terminus legis et initium Evangelii. Et ideo magis pertinebat ad eum verbo et opere inducere homines ad legem Christi quam ad observantiam veteris legis.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 John was not only a prophet, but "more than a prophet," as stated Mt. 11:9: for he was the term of the Law and the beginning of the Gospel. Therefore it was in his province to lead men, both by word and deed, to the law of Christ rather than to the observance of the Old Law.




Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismata illa Pharisaeorum erant inania, utpote ad solam munditiam carnis ordinata. Sed Baptismus Ioannis ordinabatur ad munditiam spiritualem, inducebat enim homines ad poenitentiam, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Those baptisms of the Pharisees were vain, being ordered merely unto carnal cleanliness. But the baptism of John was ordered unto spiritual cleanliness, since it led men to do penance, as stated above.

Ad tertium dicendum quod Baptismus Ioannis non fuit ordinatus a Deo nisi ut modico tempore duraret, propter causas praedictas. Et ideo non fuit commendatus aliquo praecepto communiter tradito in sacra Scriptura, sed familiari quadam revelatione spiritus sancti, ut dictum est.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The baptism of John was intended by God to last only for a short time, for the reasons given above (
Article [1]
). Therefore it was not the subject of a general commandment set down in Sacred Writ, but of a certain interior revelation of the Holy Ghost, as stated above.

Ad secundum dicendum quod illa confessio peccatorum non fiebat ad remissionem peccatorum statim per Baptismum Ioannis exhibendam, sed consequendam per poenitentiam consequentem, et Baptismum Christi, ad quem poenitentia illa praeparabat.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 That confession of sins was not made unto the remission of sins, to be realized immediately through the baptism of John, but to be obtained through subsequent penance and through the baptism of Christ, for which that penance was a preparation.




Ad tertium dicendum quod circumcisio instituta erat in remedium originalis peccati. Sed Baptismus Ioannis ad hoc non erat institutus, sed solum erat praeparatorius ad Baptismum Christi, ut dictum est. Sacramenta autem ex vi institutionis suum habent effectum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Circumcision was instituted as a remedy for original sin. Whereas the baptism of John was not instituted for this purpose, but was merely in preparation for the baptism of Christ, as stated above; whereas the sacraments attain their effect through the force of their institution.
