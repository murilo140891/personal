# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod res inanimatae non operantur ad interiorem effectum nisi instrumentaliter, ut dictum est. Et similiter homines non operantur ad sacramentorum effectum nisi per modum ministerii, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Inanimate things do not produce the sacramental effect, except instrumentally, as stated above. In like manner neither do men produce the sacramental effect, except ministerially, as also stated above.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus non ex invidia praetermisit potestatem excellentiae ministris communicare, sed propter fidelium utilitatem, ne in homine spem ponerent, et essent diversa sacramenta, ex quibus divisio in Ecclesia oriretur; sicut apud illos qui dicebant, ego sum Pauli, ego autem Apollo, ego vero Cephae, ut dicitur I Cor. I.
        


Reply to Objection 1:
 It was not through jealousy that Christ refrained from communicating to ministers His power of excellence, but for the good of the faithful; lest they should put their trust in men, and lest there should be various kinds of sacraments, giving rise to division in the Church; as may be seen in those who said: "I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, and I of Cephas" (
1 Cor. 1:12
).




Ad secundum dicendum quod obiectio illa procedit de potestate auctoritatis, quae convenit Christo secundum quod est Deus. Licet et potestas excellentiae possit auctoritas nominari per comparationem ad alios ministros. Unde super illud I Cor. I, divisus est Christus? Dicit Glossa quod potuit eis dare auctoritatem Baptismi, quibus contulit ministerium.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 This objection is true of the power of authority, which belongs to Christ as God. At the same time the power of excellence can be called authority in comparison to other ministers. Whence on 1 Cor. 1:13: "Is Christ divided?" the gloss says that "He could give power of authority in baptizing, to those to whom He gave the power of administering it."




Ad tertium dicendum quod ad hoc inconveniens evitandum, ne scilicet multa capita in Ecclesia essent, Christus noluit potestatem suae excellentiae ministris communicare. Si tamen communicasset, ipse esset caput principaliter, alii vero secundario.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 It was in order to avoid the incongruity of many heads in the Church, that Christ was unwilling to communicate to ministers His power of excellence. If, however, He had done so, He would have been Head in chief; the others in subjection to Him.

Ad secundum dicendum quod sancti qui sunt in caelo, sunt similes Angelis quantum ad participationem gloriae, non autem quantum ad conditionem naturae. Et per consequens neque quantum ad sacramenta.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The saints in heaven resemble the angels as to their share of glory, but not as to the conditions of their nature: and consequently not in regard to the sacraments.




Ad tertium dicendum quod mali homines non habent quod possint ministrare in sacramentis ex hoc quod per malitiam sunt membra Diaboli. Et ideo non sequitur quod Diabolus, qui est eorum caput, magis hoc possit.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Wicked men do not owe their power of conferring sacraments to their being members of the devil. Consequently, it does not follow that "a fortiori" the devil, their head, can do so.

Ad tertium dicendum quod mali homines non habent quod possint ministrare in sacramentis ex hoc quod per malitiam sunt membra Diaboli. Et ideo non sequitur quod Diabolus, qui est eorum caput, magis hoc possit.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Wicked men do not owe their power of conferring sacraments to their being members of the devil. Consequently, it does not follow that "a fortiori" the devil, their head, can do so.

Ad tertium dicendum quod potestas ministrandi sacramenta pertinet ad spiritualem characterem, qui indelebilis est, ut ex supra dictis patet. Et ideo per hoc quod aliquis ab Ecclesia suspenditur vel excommunicatur, vel etiam degradatur, non amittit potestatem conferendi sacramentum, sed licentiam utendi hac potestate. Et ideo sacramentum quidem confert, sed tamen peccat conferendo. Et similiter ille qui ab eo accipit sacramentum, et sic non percipit rem sacramenti, nisi forte per ignorantiam excusetur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The power of administering the sacraments belongs to the spiritual character which is indelible, as explained above (
Question [63]
, 
Article [3]
). Consequently, if a man be suspended by the Church, or excommunicated or degraded, he does not lose the power of conferring sacraments, but the permission to use this power. Wherefore he does indeed confer the sacrament, but he sins in so doing. He also sins that receives a sacrament from such a man: so that he does not receive the reality of the sacrament, unless ignorance excuses him.

Respondeo dicendum quod intentio ministri potest perverti dupliciter. Uno modo, respectu ipsius sacramenti, puta cum aliquis non intendit sacramentum conferre, sed delusorie aliquid agere. Et talis perversitas tollit veritatem sacramenti, praecipue quando suam intentionem exterius manifestat.
        
I answer that,
 The minister's intention may be perverted in two ways. First in regard to the sacrament: for instance, when a man does not intend to confer a sacrament, but to make a mockery of it. Such a perverse intention takes away the truth of the sacrament, especially if it be manifested outwardly.




Alio modo potest perverti intentio ministri quantum ad id quod sequitur sacramentum, puta si sacerdos intendat aliquam feminam baptizare ut abutatur ea; vel si intendat conficere corpus Christi ut eo ad veneficia utatur. Et quia prius non dependet a posteriori, inde est quod talis intentionis perversitas veritatem sacramenti non tollit, sed ipse minister ex tali intentione graviter peccat.
        
Secondly, the minister's intention may be perverted as to something that follows the sacrament: for instance, a priest may intend to baptize a woman so as to be able to abuse her; or to consecrate the Body of Christ, so as to use it for sorcery. And because that which comes first does not depend on that which follows, consequently such a perverse intention does not annul the sacrament; but the minister himself sins grievously in having such an intention.




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Ecclesiae intentio recta est et quantum ad sacramenti perfectionem, et quantum ad sacramenti usum, sed prima rectitudo perficit sacramentum, secunda operatur ad meritum. Et ideo minister qui conformat intentionem suam Ecclesiae quantum ad primam rectitudinem, non autem quantum ad secundam, perficit quidem sacramentum, sed non est sibi ad meritum.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The Church has a good intention both as to the validity of the sacrament and as to the use thereof: but it is the former intention that perfects the sacrament, while the latter conduces to the meritorious effect. Consequently, the minister who conforms his intention to the Church as to the former rectitude, but not as to the latter, perfects the sacrament indeed, but gains no merit for himself.




Ad secundum dicendum quod intentio ludicra vel iocosa excludit primam rectitudinem intentionis, per quam perficitur sacramentum. Et ideo non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The intention of mimicry or fun excludes the first kind of right intention, necessary for the validity of a sacrament. Consequently, there is no comparison.




Ad tertium dicendum quod perversa intentio pervertit opus intendentis, non autem opus alterius. Et ideo ex perversa intentione ministri pervertitur id quod agit in sacramentis inquantum est opus eius, non inquantum est opus Christi, cuius est minister. Et est simile si minister alicuius hominis prava intentione deferret pauperibus eleemosynam, quam dominus recta intentione mandaret.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 A perverse intention perverts the action of the one who has such an intention, not the action of another. Consequently, the perverse intention of the minister perverts the sacrament in so far as it is his action: not in so far as it is the action of Christ, Whose minister he is. It is just as if the servant [minister] of some man were to carry alms to the poor with a wicked intention, whereas his master had commanded him with a good intention to do so.
