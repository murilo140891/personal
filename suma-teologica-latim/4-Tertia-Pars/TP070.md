Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ratio illa procederet si ex circumcisione esset iustitia aliter quam per fidem passionis Christi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 This argument would prove if justice were of circumcision otherwise than through faith in Christ's Passion.




Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut ante institutionem circumcisionis fides Christi futuri iustificabat tam pueros quam adultos, ita et circumcisione data. Sed antea non requirebatur aliquod signum protestativum huius fidei, quia nondum homines fideles seorsum ab infidelibus coeperant adunari ad cultum unius Dei. Probabile tamen est quod parentes fideles pro parvulis natis, et maxime in periculo existentibus, aliquas preces Deo funderent, vel aliquam benedictionem eis adhiberent, quod erat quoddam signaculum fidei, sicut adulti pro seipsis preces et sacrificia offerebant.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Just as before the institution of circumcision, faith in Christ to come justified both children and adults, so, too, after its institution. But before, there was no need of a sign expressive of this faith; because as yet believers had not begun to be united together apart from unbelievers for the worship of one God. It is probable, however, that parents who were believers offered up some prayers to God for their children, especially if these were in any danger. Or bestowed some blessing on them, as a "seal of faith"; just as the adults offered prayers and sacrifices for themselves.




Ad tertium dicendum quod populus in deserto praetermittens mandatum circumcisionis excusabatur, tum quia nesciebant quando castra movebantur; tum quia, ut Damascenus dicit, non necesse erat eos aliquod signum distinctionis habere quando seorsum ab aliis populis habitabant. Et tamen, ut Augustinus dicit, inobedientiam incurrebant qui ex contemptu praetermittebant.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 There was an excuse for the people in the desert failing to fulfil the precept of circumcision, both because they knew not when the camp was removed, and because, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) they needed no distinctive sign while they dwelt apart from other nations. Nevertheless, as Augustine says (Questions. in Josue vi), those were guilty of disobedience who failed to obey through contempt.




Videtur tamen quod nulli incircumcisi mortui fuerint in deserto, quia in Psalmo dicitur, non erat in tribubus eorum infirmus, sed illi soli videntur mortui in deserto qui fuerant in Aegypto circumcisi. Si tamen aliqui ibi incircumcisi mortui sunt, eadem ratio est de his et de his qui moriebantur ante circumcisionis institutionem. Quod etiam intelligendum est de pueris qui moriebantur ante octavum diem tempore legis.
        

          It seems, however, that none of the uncircumcised died in the desert, for it is written (
Ps. 104:37
): "There was not among their tribes one that was feeble": and that those alone died in the desert, who had been circumcised in Egypt. If, however, some of the uncircumcised did die there, the same applies to them as to those who died before the institution of circumcision. And this applies also to those children who, at the time of the Law, died before the eighth day.




Ad quartum dicendum quod in circumcisione auferebatur originale peccatum ex parte personae, remanebat tamen impedimentum intrandi in regnum caelorum ex parte totius naturae, quod fuit sublatum per passionem Christi. Et ideo etiam Baptismus ante passionem Christi non introducebat in regnum. Sed circumcisio, si haberet locum post passionem Christi, introduceret in regnum.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Original sin was taken away in circumcision, in regard to the person; but on the part of the entire nature, there remained the obstacle to the entrance of the kingdom of heaven, which obstacle was removed by Christ's Passion. Consequently, before Christ's Passion not even Baptism gave entrance to the kingdom. But were circumcision to avail after Christ's Passion, it would give entrance to the kingdom.




Ad quintum dicendum quod adulti, quando circumcidebantur, consequebantur remissionem non solum originalis, sed etiam actualium peccatorum, non tamen ita quod liberarentur ab omni reatu poenae, sicut in Baptismo, in quo confertur copiosior gratia.
        
Reply to Objection 5:
 When adults were circumcised, they received remission not only of original, but also of actual sin: yet not so as to be delivered from all debt of punishment, as in Baptism, in which grace is conferred more copiously.
