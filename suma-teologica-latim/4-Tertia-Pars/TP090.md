 Of its division into subjective parts.

Quarto, de divisione eius in partes subiectivas.
        


(4)
 Of its division into subjective parts.

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod quodlibet sacramentum habet simplicitatem ratione virtutis divinae, quae in eo operatur. Sed virtus divina, propter sui magnitudinem, operari potest et per unum et per multa, ratione quorum alicui sacramento possunt partes assignari.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Every sacrament is something simple by reason of the Divine power, which operates therein: but the Divine power is so great that it can operate both through one and through many, and by reason of these many, parts may be assigned to a particular sacrament.




Ad secundum dicendum quod poenitentiae secundum quod est virtus, non assignantur partes, actus enim humani, qui multiplicantur in poenitentia, non comparantur ad habitum virtutis sicut partes, sed sicut effectus. Unde relinquitur quod partes assignentur poenitentiae inquantum est sacramentum, ad quod actus humani comparantur ut materia. In aliis autem sacramentis materia non sunt actus humani, sed aliqua res exterior, una quidem simplex, ut aqua vel oleum; sive composita, ut chrisma. Et ideo aliis sacramentis non assignantur partes.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Parts are not assigned to penance as a virtue: because the human acts of which there are several in penance, are related to the habit of virtue, not as its parts, but as its effects. It follows, therefore, that parts are assigned to Penance as a sacrament, to which the human acts are related as matter: whereas in the other sacraments the matter does not consist of human acts, but of some one external thing, either simple, as water or oil, or compound, as chrism, and so parts are not assigned to the other sacraments.




Ad tertium dicendum quod peccata sunt materia remota poenitentiae, inquantum scilicet sunt ut materia vel obiectum humanorum actuum, qui sunt propria materia poenitentiae prout est sacramentum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Sins are the remote matter of Penance, inasmuch, to wit, as they are the matter or object of the human acts, which are the proper matter of Penance as a sacrament.

Pertinet autem ad poenitentiam ut detestetur peccata praeterita, cum proposito immutandi vitam in melius, quod est quasi poenitentiae finis. Et quia moralia recipiunt speciem secundum finem, ut in secunda parte habitum est; consequens est quod diversae species poenitentiae accipiantur secundum diversas immutationes quas poenitens intendit.
        
Now it belongs to penance to detest one's past sins, and to purpose, at the same time, to change one's life for the better, which is the end, so to speak, of penance. And since moral matters take their species from the end, as stated in the FS, Question [1], Article [3]; FS, 18, Articles [4],6, it is reasonable to distinguish various species of penance, according to the various changes intended by the penitent.




Est autem triplex immutatio a poenitente intenta. Prima quidem per regenerationem in novam vitam. Et haec pertinet ad poenitentiam quae est ante Baptismum. Secunda autem immutatio est per reformationem vitae praeteritae iam corruptae. Et haec pertinet ad poenitentiam mortalium post Baptismum. Tertia autem immutatio est in perfectiorem operationem vitae. Et haec pertinet ad poenitentiam venialium, quae remittuntur per aliquem ferventem actum caritatis, ut supra dictum est.
        

          Accordingly there is a threefold change intended by the penitent. The first is by regeneration unto a new life, and this belongs to that penance which precedes Baptism. The second is by reforming one's past life after it has been already destroyed, and this belongs to penance for mortal sins committed after Baptism. The third is by changing to a more perfect operation of life, and this belongs to penance for venial sins, which are remitted through a fervent act of charity, as stated above (
Question [87]
, 
Articles [2]
,3).




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod poenitentia quae est ante Baptismum, non est sacramentum, sed est actus virtutis disponens ad sacramentum Baptismi.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 The penance which precedes Baptism is not a sacrament, but an act of virtue disposing one to that sacrament.




Ad secundum dicendum quod poenitentia quae delet peccata mortalia delet etiam venialia, sed non convertitur. Et ideo hae duae poenitentiae se habent sicut perfectum et imperfectum.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 The penance which washes away mortal sins, washes away venial sins also, but the converse does not hold. Wherefore these two species of penance are related to one another as perfect and imperfect.




Ad tertium dicendum quod ante Baptismum non sunt peccata venialia sine mortalibus. Et quia veniale sine mortali dimitti non potest, ut supra dictum est; ideo ante Baptismum non distinguitur poenitentia mortalium et venialium.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 Before Baptism there are no venial sins without mortal sins. And since a venial sin cannot be remitted without mortal sin, as stated above (
Question [87]
, 
Article [4]
), before Baptism, penance for mortal sins is not distinct from penance for venial sins.
