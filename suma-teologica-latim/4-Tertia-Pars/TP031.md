# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus habet affinitatem ad humanum genus secundum similitudinem speciei. Similitudo autem speciei attenditur, non secundum materiam remotam, sed secundum materiam proximam, et secundum principium activum, quod generat sibi simile in specie. Sic igitur affinitas Christi ad humanum genus sufficienter conservatur per hoc quod corpus Christi formatum est ex sanguinibus virginis, derivatis secundum originem ab Adam et aliis patribus. Nec refert ad hanc affinitatem undecumque materia illorum sanguinum sumpta fuerit, sicut nec hoc refert in generatione aliorum hominum, sicut in prima parte dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ and the human race are kindred, through the likeness of species. Now, specific likeness results not from remote but from proximate matter, and from the active principle which begets its like in species. Thus, then, the kinship of Christ and the human race is sufficiently preserved by His body being formed from the Virgin's blood, derived in its origin from Adam and the other patriarchs. Nor is this kinship affected by the matter whence this blood is taken, as neither is it in the generation of other men, as stated in the FP, Question [119], Article [2], ad 3.

Ad tertium dicendum quod in humana natura, ante Christum, erat vulnus, idest infectio originalis peccati, in actu. Medicina autem vulneris non erat ibi actu, sed solum secundum virtutem originis, prout ab illis patribus propaganda erat caro Christi.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Before Christ, there was actually in human nature a wound, i.e. the infection of original sin. But the balm to heal the wound was not there actually, but only by a certain virtue of origin, forasmuch as from those patriarchs the flesh of Christ was to be propagated.

Ad quartum dicendum quod sacerdotium leviticum secundum carnis originem derivabatur. Unde non minus fuit in Abraham quam in levi. Unde per hoc quod Abraham decimas dedit Melchisedec tanquam maiori, ostenditur sacerdotium Melchisedec, inquantum gerit figuram Christi, esse maius sacerdotio levitico. Sacerdotium autem Christi non sequitur carnis originem, sed gratiam spiritualem. Et ideo potest esse quod pater dedit decimas alicui sacerdoti tanquam minor maiori, et tamen filius eius, si sit pontifex, est maior illo sacerdote, non propter carnis originem, sed propter gratiam spiritualem, quam habet a Christo.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 The levitical priesthood was handed down through carnal origin: wherefore it was not less in Abraham than in Levi. Consequently, since Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedech as to one greater than he, it follows that the priesthood of Melchisedech, inasmuch as he was a figure of Christ, was greater than that of Levi. But the priesthood of Christ does not result from carnal origin, but from spiritual grace. Therefore it is possible that a father pay tithes to a priest, as the less to the greater, and yet his son, if he be a bishop, is greater than that priest, not through carnal origin, but through the spiritual grace which he has received from Christ.
