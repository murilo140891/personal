# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod illud statutum intelligitur de illis qui publicam poenitentiam agunt, qui postmodum non possunt ad maiorem provehi gradum. Nam et Petrus post negationem pastor ovium Christi constitutus est, ut patet Ioan. ult. Ubi dicit Chrysostomus quod Petrus post negationem et poenitentiam ostendit se habere maiorem fiduciam ad Christum. Qui enim in cena non audebat interrogare, sed Ioanni interrogationem commisit, huic postea et praepositura fratrum credita est, et non solum non committit alteri interrogare quae ad ipsum pertinent, sed de reliquo ipse pro Ioanne magistrum interrogat.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This statute is to be understood as applying to those who do public penance, for these cannot be promoted to a higher order. For Peter, after his denial, was made shepherd of Christ's sheep, as appears from Jn. 21:21, where Chrysostom comments as follows: "After his denial and repentance Peter gives proof of greater confidence in Christ: for whereas, at the supper, he durst not ask Him, but deputed John to ask in his stead, afterwards he was placed at the head of his brethren, and not only did not depute another to ask for him, what concerned him, but henceforth asks the Master instead of John."
