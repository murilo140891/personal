# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod filius Dei assumpsit corpus passibile, ut infra dicetur, sed animam perfectam scientia et gratia. Et ideo corpus eius fuit convenienter subiectum impressioni caelestium corporum, anima vero eius non fuit subiecta impressioni caelestium spirituum.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 The Son of God assumed a passible body (as will be said hereafter (
Question [14]
, 
Article [1]
)) and a soul perfect in knowledge and grace (

, 
Article [1]
, ad 1; 
Article [4]
). Hence His body was rightly subject to the impression of heavenly bodies; but His soul was not subject to the impression of heavenly spirits.
