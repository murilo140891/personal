# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de eo quod est causa gratiae per modum principalis agentis, hoc enim est proprium Dei, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 This argument considers that which causes grace as principal agent; for this belongs to God alone, as stated above.

Praeterea, sacramenta ordinantur ad hoc quod homines per ea gratiam consequantur. Sed gratia, cum sit accidens, non potest transire de subiecto in subiectum. Ergo pro nihilo esset gratia in sacramentis.
        
Objection 2:
 Further, sacraments are instituted as means whereby men may obtain grace. But since grace is an accident it cannot pass from one subject to another. Therefore it would be of no account if grace were in the sacraments.




Praeterea, spirituale non continetur a corporali, etiam si in eo sit, non enim anima continetur a corpore, sed potius continet corpus. Ergo videtur quod gratia, cum sit quoddam spirituale, non contineatur in sacramento corporali.
        
Objection 3:
 Further, a spiritual thing is not contained by a corporeal, even if it be therein; for the soul is not contained by the body; rather does it contain the body. Since, therefore, grace is something spiritual, it seems that it cannot be contained in a corporeal sacrament.




Sed contra est quod Hugo de sancto Victore dicit, quod sacramentum ex sanctificatione invisibilem gratiam continet.
        
On the contrary,
 Hugh of S. Victor says (De Sacram. i) that "a sacrament, through its being sanctified, contains an invisible grace."




Respondeo dicendum quod multipliciter dicitur aliquid esse in alio, inter quos duplici modo gratia est in sacramentis. Uno modo, sicut in signis, nam sacramentum est signum gratiae. Alio modo, sicut in causa. Nam, sicut dictum est, sacramentum novae legis est instrumentalis gratiae causa. Unde gratia est in sacramento novae legis, non quidem secundum similitudinem speciei, sicut effectus est in causa univoca; neque etiam secundum aliquam formam propriam et permanentem proportionatam ad talem effectum, sicut sunt effectus in causis non univocis, puta res generatae in sole; sed secundum quandam instrumentalem virtutem, quae est fluens et incompleta in esse naturae, ut infra dicetur.
        


I answer that,
 A thing is said to be in another in various ways; in two of which grace is said to be in the sacraments. First, as in its sign; for a sacrament is a sign of grace. Secondly, as in its cause; for, as stated above (
Article [1]
) a sacrament of the New Law is an instrumental cause of grace. Wherefore grace is in a sacrament of the New Law, not as to its specific likeness, as an effect in its univocal cause; nor as to some proper and permanent form proportioned to such an effect, as effects in non-univocal causes, for instance, as things generated are in the sun; but as to a certain instrumental power transient and incomplete in its natural being, as will be explained later on (
Article [4]
).




Ad primum ergo dicendum quod gratia non dicitur esse in sacramento sicut in subiecto; neque sicut in vase prout vas est locus quidam, sed prout vas dicitur instrumentum alicuius operis faciendi, secundum quod dicitur Ezech. IX, unusquisque vas interfectionis habet in manu sua.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 Grace is said to be in a sacrament not as in its subject; nor as in a vessel considered as a place, but understood as the instrument of some work to be done, according to Ezech. 9:1: "Everyone hath a destroying vessel [Douay: 'weapon'] in his hand."




Ad secundum dicendum quod, quamvis accidens non transeat a subiecto in subiectum, transit tamen a causa per instrumentum aliqualiter in subiectum, non ut eodem modo sit in eis, sed in unoquoque secundum propriam rationem.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 Although an accident does not pass from one subject to another, nevertheless in a fashion it does pass from its cause into its subject through the instrument; not so that it be in each of these in the same way, but in each according to its respective nature.




Ad tertium dicendum quod spirituale existens perfecte in aliquo, continet ipsum, et non continetur ab eo. Sed gratia est in sacramento secundum esse fluens et incompletum. Et ideo non inconvenienter sacramentum dicitur gratiam continere.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 If a spiritual thing exist perfectly in something, it contains it and is not contained by it. But, in a sacrament, grace has a passing and incomplete mode of being: and consequently it is not unfitting to say that the sacraments contain grace.

Praeterea, spirituale non continetur a corporali, etiam si in eo sit, non enim anima continetur a corpore, sed potius continet corpus. Ergo videtur quod gratia, cum sit quoddam spirituale, non contineatur in sacramento corporali.
