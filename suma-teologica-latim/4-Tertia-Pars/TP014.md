# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod Christus in huiusmodi defectibus assimilatus est aliis hominibus quantum ad qualitatem defectuum, non autem quantum ad causam. Et ideo non contraxit huiusmodi defectus, sicut et alii.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Christ was made like to other men in the quality and not in the cause of these defects; and hence, unlike others, He did not contract them.

Ad tertium dicendum quod mors in omnes homines devenit ex peccato primi parentis, non autem quidam alii defectus, licet sint morte minores. Unde non est similis ratio.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Death comes to all men from the sin of our first parent; but not other defects, although they are less than death. Hence there is no parity.
