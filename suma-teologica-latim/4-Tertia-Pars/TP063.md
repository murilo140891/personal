# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, character ordinatur ad ea quae sunt divini cultus. Qui quidem est quaedam fidei protestatio per exteriora signa. Et ideo oportet quod character sit in cognitiva potentia animae, in qua est fides.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As stated above, a character is ordained unto things pertaining to the Divine worship; which is a protestation of faith expressed by exterior signs. Consequently, a character needs to be in the soul's cognitive power, where also is faith.

Ad tertium dicendum quod, quamvis post hanc vitam non remaneat exterior cultus, remanet tamen finis illius cultus. Et ideo post hanc vitam remanet character, et in bonis ad eorum gloriam, et in malis ad eorum ignominiam, sicut etiam militaris character remanet in militibus post adeptam victoriam, et in his qui vicerunt ad gloriam, et in his qui sunt victi ad poenam.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Although external worship does not last after this life, yet its end remains. Consequently, after this life the character remains, both in the good as adding to their glory, and in the wicked as increasing their shame: just as the character of the military service remains in the soldiers after the victory, as the boast of the conquerors, and the disgrace of the conquered.
