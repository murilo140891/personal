# Summa Theologica

Ad secundum dicendum quod in passione Christi, cuius hoc sacramentum est memoriale, non fuerunt aliae partes corporis ab invicem separatae, sicut sanguis, sed corpus indissolutum permansit, secundum quod legitur Exod. XII, os non comminuetis ex eo. Et ideo in hoc sacramento seorsum consecratur sanguis a corpore, non autem alia pars ab alia.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 In Christ's Passion, of which this is the memorial, the other parts of the body were not separated from one another, as the blood was, but the body remained entire, according to Ex. 12:46: "You shall not break a bone thereof." And therefore in this sacrament the blood is consecrated apart from the body, but no other part is consecrated separately from the rest.




Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, corpus Christi non est sub specie vini ex vi sacramenti, sed ex reali concomitantia. Et ideo per consecrationem vini non fit ibi corpus Christi per se, sed concomitanter.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As stated above, the body of Christ is not under the species of wine by the power of the sacrament, but by real concomitance: and therefore by the consecration of the wine the body of Christ is not there of itself, but concomitantly.

Quandoque vero contingit talis apparitio non per solam immutationem videntium, sed specie quae videtur realiter exterius existente. Et hoc quidem videtur esse quando sub tali specie ab omnibus videtur; et non ad horam, sed per longum tempus ita permanet. Et in hoc casu quidam dicunt quod est propria species corporis Christi. Nec obstat quod quandoque non videtur ibi totus Christus, sed aliqua pars carnis; vel etiam videtur non in specie iuvenili, sed in effigie puerili, quia in potestate est corporis gloriosi, ut infra dicetur, quod videatur ab oculo non glorificato vel secundum totum vel secundum partem, et in effigie vel propria vel aliena, ut infra dicetur.
        

          But it sometimes happens that such apparition comes about not merely by a change wrought in the beholders, but by an appearance which really exists outwardly. And this indeed is seen to happen when it is beheld by everyone under such an appearance, and it remains so not for an hour, but for a considerable time; and, in this case some think that it is the proper species of Christ's body. Nor does it matter that sometimes Christ's entire body is not seen there, but part of His flesh, or else that it is not seen in youthful guise. but in the semblance of a child, because it lies within the power of a glorified body for it to be seen by a non-glorified eye either entirely or in part, and under its own semblance or in strange guise, as will be said later (

Sed hoc videtur esse inconveniens. Primo quidem, quia corpus Christi non potest in propria specie videri nisi in uno loco, in quo definitive continetur. Unde, cum videatur in propria specie et adoretur in caelo, sub propria specie non videtur in hoc sacramento. Secundo, quia corpus gloriosum, quod apparet ut vult, post apparitionem cum voluerit disparet, sicut dicitur, Luc. ult., quod dominus ab oculis discipulorum evanuit. Hoc autem quod sub specie carnis in hoc sacramento apparet, diu permanet, quinimmo quandoque legitur esse inclusum, et multorum episcoporum consilio in pixide reservatum; quod nefas est de Christo sentire secundum propriam speciem.
        

          But this seems unlikely. First of all, because Christ's body under its proper species can be seen only in one place, wherein it is definitively contained. Hence since it is seen in its proper species, and is adored in heaven, it is not seen under its proper species in this sacrament. Secondly, because a glorified body, which appears at will, disappears when it wills after the apparition; thus it is related (
Lk. 24:31
) that our Lord "vanished out of sight" of the disciples. But that which appears under the likeness of flesh in this sacrament, continues for a long time; indeed, one reads of its being sometimes enclosed, and, by order of many bishops, preserved in a pyx, which it would be wicked to think of Christ under His proper semblance.




Et ideo dicendum quod, manentibus dimensionibus quae prius fuerunt, fit miraculose quaedam immutatio circa alia accidentia, puta figuram et colorem et alia huiusmodi, ut videatur caro vel sanguis, aut etiam puer. Et, sicut prius dictum est, hoc non est deceptio, quia fit in figuram cuiusdam veritatis, scilicet ad ostendendum per hanc miraculosam apparitionem quod in hoc sacramento est vere corpus Christi et sanguis. Et sic patet quod, remanentibus dimensionibus, quae sunt fundamenta aliorum accidentium, ut infra dicetur, remanet vere corpus Christi in hoc sacramento.
        

          Consequently, it remains to be said, that, while the dimensions remain the same as before, there is a miraculous change wrought in the other accidents, such as shape, color, and the rest, so that flesh, or blood, or a child, is seen. And, as was said already, this is not deception, because it is done "to represent the truth," namely, to show by this miraculous apparition that Christ's body and blood are truly in this sacrament. And thus it is clear that as the dimensions remain, which are the foundation of the other accidents, as we shall see later on (

Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, facta tali apparitione, species sacramentales quandoque quidem totaliter manent in seipsis, quandoque autem secundum illud quod est principale in eis, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 1:
 When such apparition takes place, the sacramental species sometimes continue entire in themselves; and sometimes only as to that which is principal, as was said above.




Ad secundum dicendum quod in huiusmodi apparitionibus, sicut dictum est, non videtur propria species Christi, sed species miraculose formata vel in oculis intuentium, vel etiam in ipsis sacramentalibus dimensionibus, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 2:
 As stated above, during such apparitions Christ's proper semblance is not seen, but a species miraculously formed either in the eyes of the beholders, or in the sacramental dimensions themselves, as was said above.




Ad tertium dicendum quod dimensiones panis et vini consecrati manent, immutatione circa eas miraculose facta quantum ad alia accidentia, ut dictum est.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 The dimensions of the consecrated bread and wine continue, while a miraculous change is wrought in the other accidents, as stated above.
