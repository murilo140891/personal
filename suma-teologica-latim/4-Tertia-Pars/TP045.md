# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod, inter praedictas quatuor dotes, sola claritas est qualitas ipsius personae in seipsa, aliae vero tres dotes non percipiuntur nisi in aliquo actu vel motu, seu passione. Ostendit igitur Christus in seipso aliqua illarum trium dotium indicia, puta agilitatis, cum supra undas maris ambulavit; subtilitatis, quando de clauso utero virginis exivit; impassibilitatis, quando de manibus Iudaeorum, vel praecipitare vel lapidare eum volentium, illaesus evasit. Nec tamen propter illas transfiguratus dicitur, sed propter solam claritatem, quae pertinet ad aspectum personae ipsius.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Of those four gifts, clarity alone is a quality of the very person in himself; whereas the other three are not perceptible, save in some action or movement, or in some passion. Christ, then, did show in Himself certain indications of those three gifts---of agility, for instance, when He walked on the waves of the sea; of subtlety, when He came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; of impassibility, when He escaped unhurt from the hands of the Jews who wished to hurl Him down or to stone Him. And yet He is not said, on account of this, to be transfigured, but only on account of clarity, which pertains to the aspect of His Person.

Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Chrysostomus dicit, super Matth., Moyses et Elias in medium adducuntur propter multas rationes. Prima est haec. Quia enim turbae dicebant eum esse Eliam vel Ieremiam aut unum ex prophetis, capita prophetarum secum ducit, ut saltem hinc appareat differentia servorum et domini. Secunda ratio est, quia Moyses legem dedit, Elias pro gloria domini aemulator fuit. Unde per hoc quod simul cum Christo apparent, excluditur calumnia Iudaeorum accusantium Christum tanquam transgressorem legis, et blasphemum Dei sibi gloriam usurpantem. Tertia ratio est, ut ostendat se habere potestatem mortis et vitae, et esse iudicem mortuorum et vivorum, per hoc quod Moysen iam mortuum, et Eliam adhuc viventem, secum ducit. Quarta ratio est quia, sicut Lucas dicit, loquebantur cum eo de excessu, quem completurus erat in Ierusalem, idest de passione et morte sua. Et ideo, ut super hoc discipulorum animos confirmaret, inducit eos in medium qui se morti exposuerunt pro Deo, nam Moyses cum periculo mortis se obtulit Pharaoni, Elias vero regi Achab. Quinta ratio est, quia volebat ut discipuli eius aemularentur Moysi mansuetudinem, et zelum Eliae. Sextam rationem addit Hilarius, ut ostenderet scilicet se per legem, quam dedit Moyses, et per prophetas, inter quos fuit Elias praecipuus, esse praedicatum.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 As Chrysostom says on Mt. 17:3: "Moses and Elias are brought forward for many reasons." And, first of all, "because the multitude said He was Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets, He brings the leaders of the prophets with Him; that hereby at least they might see the difference between the servants and their Lord." Another reason was "... that Moses gave the Law... while Elias... was jealous for the glory of God." Therefore by appearing together with Christ, they show how falsely the Jews "accused Him of transgressing the Law, and of blasphemously appropriating to Himself the glory of God." A third reason was "to show that He has power of death and life, and that He is the judge of the dead and the living; by bringing with Him Moses who had died, and Elias who still lived." A fourth reason was because, as Luke says (9:31), "they spoke" with Him "of His decease that He should accomplish in Jerusalem," i.e. of His Passion and death. Therefore, "in order to strengthen the hearts of His disciples with a view to this," He sets before them those who had exposed themselves to death for God's sake: since Moses braved death in opposing Pharaoh, and Elias in opposing Achab. A fifth reason was that "He wished His disciples to imitate the meekness of Moses and the zeal of Elias." Hilary adds a sixth reason---namely, in order to signify that He had been foretold by the Law, which Moses gave them, and by the prophets, of whom Elias was the principal.




Ad quartum dicendum quod alta mysteria non sunt omnibus exponenda immediate, sed per maiores suo tempore ad alios debent devenire. Et ideo, ut Chrysostomus dicit, assumpsit tres tanquam potiores. Nam Petrus excellens fuit in dilectione quam habuit ad Christum et iterum in potestate sibi commissa; Ioannes vero in privilegio amoris quo a Christo diligebatur propter suam virginitatem, et iterum propter praerogativam evangelicae doctrinae; Iacobus autem propter praerogativam martyrii. Et tamen hos ipsos noluit hoc quod viderant aliis annuntiare ante resurrectionem, ne, ut Hieronymus dicit, incredibile esset, pro rei magnitudine; et, post tantam gloriam, sequens crux scandalum faceret; vel etiam totaliter impediretur a populo; et ut, cum essent spiritu sancto repleti, tunc gestorum spiritualium testes essent.
        
Reply to Objection 4:
 Lofty mysteries should not be immediately explained to everyone, but should be handed down through superiors to others in their proper turn. Consequently, as Chrysostom says (on Mt. 17:3), "He took these three as being superior to the rest." For "Peter excelled in the love" he bore to Christ and in the power bestowed on him; John in the privilege of Christ's love for him on account of his virginity, and, again, on account of his being privileged to be an Evangelist; James on account of the privilege of martyrdom. Nevertheless He did not wish them to tell others what they had seen before His Resurrection; "lest," as Jerome says on Mt. 17:19, "such a wonderful thing should seem incredible to them; and lest, after hearing of so great glory, they should be scandalized at the Cross" that followed; or, again, "lest [the Cross] should be entirely hindered by the people" [*Bede, Hom. xviii; cf. Catena Aurea]; and "in order that they might then be witnesses of spiritual things when they should be filled with the Holy Ghost" [*Hilary, in Matth. xvii].
