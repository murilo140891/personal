# Summa Theologica

Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, sacramentum Baptismi est potissimum necessitate, sed quantum ad perfectionem, sunt quaedam alia potiora, quae episcopis reservantur.
        


Reply to Objection 3:
 As stated above (
Question [65]
, 
Article [3]
), the sacrament of Baptism holds the first place in the order of necessity; but in the order of perfection there are other greater sacraments which are reserved to bishops.

Ad tertium dicendum quod confusio disciplinae esset nisi esset unus principalis instructor. Et ideo in Baptismo unus debet esse principalis susceptor. Alii tamen possunt admitti quasi coadiutores.
        
Reply to Objection 3:
 Education would be full of confusion if there were more than one head instructor. Wherefore there should be one principal sponsor in Baptism: but others can be allowed as assistants.
